"Sidney","Color: Black","Very Good but Unexpected Downside","10 Jul 2020","This is my 3rd robot vacuum.  My first was a Ecovacs bought on sale for under $200 about 3 years ago.  I loved it but after 7 months, it stopped connecting to internet.  Company sent replacement (after 10 calls to company).  Second one did the exact same thing - 7 months in it stopped connecting to internet.  Company sent a 3rd replacement (another 10 calls and a very unpleasant company person telling me that even if the 3rd replacement stops working they will not replace again).  Again, it stopped at about 7 months.  While the thing worked, it was great - enough power to get over kitchen/dinning room transition bump, good app that let me know how long it ran for each cleaning, easy to schedule cleanings (I usually have it set for twice a week while I'm at work), an a long enough battery that even though it was ping ponging around space, it would really clean everything. Decided to change brands.  I researched for about a month and decided on an Eufy for about $220.  I picked this one because it was thinner than the Ecovacs and had good reviews.  One of the things I didn't like about the ecovacs (aside from the 7 month lifespan) was that 1 out of every 3 runs through house, it would get wedged under cabinets in kitchen because the very thin carpet runner was just a mm too high and if front wheel was on tile and back wheel was still on carpet near the cabinets, wedge city.  The Eufy never got wedged but a huge problem was that it did not have the power to get over the divider bump between kitchen tile and hardwood floor in dinning room (bathroom was same issue).  I pushed it into kitchen and bathroom for a year.  I also did not like the app because it did not tell you how long it ran for each time.  Battery life was good and house felt ""vacuumed"" when I got home from work (I blocked off kitchen/bath so it would not get stuck but that is not really the point of having a robot vacuum - I don't want to have to vacuum kitchen/bath when I get home). This time I really did my research and also decided to splurge.  I bought the Roboroc Pure about 2 weeks ago.  This one is not the random ping pong, but the mapping kind.  Easy to set up and connect to internet.  I really like that the app give lots of info such as how much battery is used, how long cleaning lasted for each run, and it was easy to schedule run times.  It has gone through my house 4 times.  Has enough power to get over kitchen/bath transition, is thin enough so it won't get wedged under cabinets (I even checked if one wheel is on carpet and one on tile and no wedge city).  Really great suction so my all hardwood floor, 1000 sq ft house really, really feels vacuumed (except for 1 small area - see below).  No dust balls in corners that got left behind.  It runs around the perimeter first and then runs on lines through rest of space.  It makes one pass through house and returns to dock. Here is the one thing I wish was different about this vacuum.  With the ping pong robots, they need long battery life because they just go random around the space until the battery needs recharging and then it goes back to dock.  They ran over same space multiple times in my house (not that big) so everything was really picked up.  This robot runs through house once and then goes back to base even if battery still has life.  The run time is about 45 minutes and it still has 70% battery left.  I close doors to office and spare room because they are very small rooms with not much floor space to vacuum (too much furniture to make it worth it).  I wish it would go back over house a second time or just keep going until battery is done.  The four times it has run, I have noticed that it did not pick up everything on carpet runner in kitchen (thin carpet tiles from Flor).  If the robot made a second pass through kitchen, I'm sure it would get everything.  I was not expecting this feature in the mapping type of vacuum and not a single reviewer mentioned this feature (I watched a lot of reviews).  I guess the solution is to just schedule more days to run but I do have to ""vacuum proof"" the house a bit before each run (pick up dog food/water bowls, pick up small rug in bathroom,  put folding chair in kitchen up on counter and put small cube  ottoman on couch). Or schedule multiple run times on same day which is what I will probably do. Other small issues to consider - 1 rotating brush up front on vacuum which does not pop off like other two vacs  This makes it harder to clean out hair that gets tangled around that brush.  Dust bin is a bit smaller than other two vacs.  The first ""map"" of my house was very accurate but the second and third time it ran, the map did not represent all the spaces.  I wanted to set it to run in just the kitchen but I did not turn on the map saving feature, so I'm not sure if I can schedule just one room.  Have to experiment with that. So far, I really do like this vacuum.  I won't ever use the mop feature so I can't say anything about that.  It has good suction, it has enough power to go everywhere,  does not get wedged anywhere, and my floors feel very clean when its done.  I was worried about only one rotating brush on front of vacuum but so far, it seems like it really does it's job.  Minus the one thing of not doing a second pass through house, I would recommend this vacuum.  I know that it takes a few weeks to really get used to each vacuum and understand the quirks (which is why I know how to ""vacuum proof"" the house before leaving for work on days it will run).  The four stars is for one pass through house, smaller dust bin, and no pop off rotating brush.","4.0","315"
"Mr. Semyon Lorberg","Color: Black","A thing to have in your home","29 May 2020","I want to start from saying that I was very skeptical in general to any robot after my bad experience with Rumba robot. After my son purchased Roborock 6 in January I was keeping my eye on his experience. I have to say that he is an IT guy and to impress him with any electronic toy is very difficult. BUT he was very pleased and even after almost 6 month his level of satisfaction didn't change and was very high. So I decided to jump. Delivery was fast and accurate. Condition of the box and it's content were perfect. I put the device to charge and noticed that a cable comes off very easy to the point that I had to monitor if it was charging or not. I sent an email to customer support and within minutes I received a reply with an explanation and further instructions. This fact by itself was surprisingly pleasant and comforting. The next hurdle was with connecting my robot with my wireless network and my phone. I have Pixel 3 phone and  I didn't expect any issues but I was wrong. It took 3 days back and forth between installing applications, checking my network and failing to connect all things together. Robot had no problem to find and to connect but my phone refused to find a device. Eventually instead of Roborock application I installed Mi home application and all problems were solved. I got a high five from my robot and gave him OK to start cleaning. It's a very smart device. Just to watch it was a very cool experience. It was spinning in all directions, moving in some whimsical patterns and eventually a map of my house was learned. It never bumped into anything but was touching gently and moving in another direction. On a screen on my phone I could see the progress and read instruction manual at the same time. Manual printed in some faded ink and to read it was an efforts for my eyes. Today after a week living with this amazing creature I tested it not only on cleaning the floor but also mopping as well. Absolutely amazing results. I have tile/laminate floor all over the house and it feels clean to touch.  At the end I receive a report about finishing the process and I can see a map that proves it. It's a very smart and complex thing and I have to learn other tricks that this robot can offer. I can name each room and tell a robot where to go and what to clean. How cool is that? I can restrict area from cleaning but I need to learn how to tell machine about it. I guess after awhile I will continue this review but at this point I can recommend it to any of my friends. Actually today I already did it while we were at the beach. I showed that a map and a moving robot while we were enjoying our sun. :)","5.0","248"
"Irene","Color: Black","Totally worth it!","07 Jun 2020","Your browser does not support HTML5 video. I been looking for robot vacuum for a while and my friend recommended this brand over irobot. At beginning I'm a little skeptical but I have to say it's beyond my expectations. There are several features I expect from it: 1) powerful vacuum with mop function, it's indeed a powerful vaccum pickup dirt, hair and dust as it went through them. I can attach the mop on the machine to clean the floor so it did the full clean job for me all-in-one. 2) good on both carpet & floor, I can turn on the carpet mode via app to increase the suction power when it clean the carpet and it's pretty good did pickup lots of hairs from it. 3) easy control, plug in and play very easy to create the map and I love that I can creat multiple area clean sequences in map 4) easy clean & maintain, it's fairly easy to detach and wash it, very easy to remove the hairs tangle on the wheel. The app also shows when to clean/replace the parts, like it 5) smart not get trap or stuck, it didn't get stuck under my furnitures or trap within wires/outlets. I keep watch how it ran over all the wires but not get trap, circling around chairs and tables but not get stuck. it pass all the tasks, pretty smart! Overall, I'm satisfied with this vacuum so I gave it a 5 stars review. Totally worth it!","5.0","180"
"Cat","Color: Black","Powerful enough to clean up after the animals! Totally self dependent!!","06 Jul 2020","If you are debating whether or not to get a robot vacuum or which one to get... worry no further! My only regret is not purchasing it sooner. I have 2 two dogs, a cat, and a parrot. One of the dogs is long haired and sheds in clumps of hair. We'd literally have to vacuum everyday and again before guests came over. Also the parrot likes to throw her seed around. The roborock does an awesome job cleaning up after them so that we don't have to. It is plenty powerful enough to keep up. The app is super easy to use. All I had to do was follow the instructions to set up the app, plug in the vacum and send it on its way. It mapped the floor itself, without getting stuck (I have 4 somewhat large threshways) and didn't require my assistance at all.","5.0","151"
"MexicanRadio","Color: Black","Good at vacuuming and mopping","12 Oct 2020","Living right near the beach has some downsides. One of them is constant tracking of sand into the house. As our beach also is alongside a desert, blown dust from the desert also add it's own layer needing cleaned. The Roborock S6 Pure has been handling our vacuuming and mopping for about a month and a half now, and we're very satisfied. We watched and read literally dozens of reviews of various vacuuming robots before we decided on this model. I strongly recommend you do the same before purchasing. there are things that operational reviews of the various robots will tell you that you won't find ever mentioned in product descriptions. One of the first things to note about vacuum robot models is that they not only perform differently at the task they're designed to do--vacuuming--but how they get the job done varies widely. While early (or later, very inexpensive) models perform a sort of ""random walk"" around the house to get the job done, that's by no means the best way for the task to be accomplished. Later models added cameras to help the 'bot find its way around. That allowed the vacuum to detect obstacles and navigate more efficiently. They also gained more intelligence. Software helps them optimize their path. Still later, many manufacturers further enhanced their software for path calculation and object avoidance. That helped even more, but the big improvement came from getting laser guidance using an infrared laser. That's what's in our Roborock, and it allows the 'bot to map an entire floor of the house with ease, and with better accuracy than the camera-only models. In addition, the improved software stores the map the 'bot makes for itself, and allows owners to see not only where the device is when cleaning, but also how much of the job is done, and where the 'bot has already cleaned. Finally, high-end versions, and the the newest models are combining front-facing cameras with laser guidance and even smarter software to allow the vacuum to avoid things inadvertently left on the floor, and to further optimize the cleaning path. The Roborock S6 Pure, as mentioned, uses a laser to build a map of your house. It then stores that map and uses it for future cleaning trips. The initial run of the device was a bit slower than subsequent trips because of the map-making effort. It also bumped into things on that initial pass. Afterwards, however, it very efficiently follows nearly the same path every time, and almost never bumps into much of anything. The resulting map is displayed in the app. There are two apps from which to choose for the Roborock S6 Pure. We chose the one called Mi Home, because it was the one recommended for those who want to integrate their vacuum with Google Home or Alexa. The second app is simply called ""Roborock"". While the app is not difficult to use, and plenty of information is provided to set it up, we've noted two things about it: 1) It's a bit picky about WiFi signal strength. The app complained it didn't have a strong enough signal when its docking station was placed in a room separated by a wall from the location of our wireless AP, which is ceiling mounted. 2) We can't get it and Google Home to play nice, so far. Although everything appears to be set up properly, Google Home complains that it can't figure out how to talk to the S6. It's turned out not to be a problem for us, because we rarely need to have the vacuum operate outside of its scheduled operations, which were very simple to set up. One thing I missed was a option to tell the device ""clean every other day"", or ""every three days,"". However, there's a custom option and one could set up multiple schedules, so it should be possible to finagle it a bit and end up with something quite close to the missing option. The Mi Home app will also allow the device to store maps for more than one floor, a process we have not attempted. Our second floor is small, and neither of us care to carry the vacuum up and down the stairs periodically (although it's no very heavy). The S6 Pure handles navigating under the dining table, and around and under all the dining room chairs just fine. Our downstairs (the primary use point of our vacuum) is open floor plan, with two additional rooms that have doors. It's approximately 550 square feet--all tile. Average cleaning time for the S6 Pure is about 36 minutes. We've set it to clean in the middle of the night. As long as the doors are open, the S6 Pure navigates into and back out of all rooms easily. It does not fit under our couch or love-seat, because recliner stuff. It also doesn't it quite fit under the bottom of kitchen cabinets into the toe-kick area. I suspect the issue with our cabinets is that they're custom built, rather than typical US-style kitchen cabinets, and given that they were built here in Mexico, from scratch, the cabinet maker might not have used the typical US dimensions for the height of toe-kicks. The S6 Pure also has a removable mop attachment, which consists of a small tank that is equipped with a cleaning pad. Water from the tank seeps into the pad to allow the robot to mop. The tank snaps into place underneath the vacuum; the vacuum does not have to be lifted completely off the floor to attach it when wanted. Just tip the rear of the unit up a bit, and slide the tank into place until it latches. The S6 Pure vacuums and mops simultaneously, it's not necessary to have separate cleaning passes for each function. Initially we did not think there was going to be enough water in the tank to completely mop the area, but we've been pleasantly surprised to see that it appears to do just fine. Once mopping is done you can easily unlatch and release the water tank. The mopping pad attaches to the tank by being slid into a groove in the tank from one side, as well as being held in place by velcro. Neither attaching nor removing the mop attachment is any trouble at all. This vacuum has really good suction, and appears to have no trouble whatsoever in picking up the typical sand, dust and dirt that gets tracked in. While the dust bin doesn't look very large, it's been more than adequate for our purposes. We empty it after every run, but it's clear that we could probably get at least three full vacuuming passes before it was actually full. After all, one of the advantages of this sort of appliance is that it can run every single day, if you choose, so accumulation of large amounts of dust, sand and dirt shouldn't be an issue. Emptying the bin is a snap. lift the lid on the vacuum squeeze a latch and lift out the bin, then pop it open over the trash can and empty it. to replace, just shut the bin and drop it into place in the vacuum, and close the top lid. The vacuum is ""chatty"" and will acknowledge when the bin is removed or replaced, when it's stuck, when it's charging and other issues. It can also send notifications to the app on your cell phone. There are a choice of ""voices"" for the robot, but from what I could see, most of them are in Chinese :-( Maintenance is relatively minimal and very easy. There's a cleaning tool to help remove stubborn stuff that may get stuck on the vacuums brush. This model has an improved brush assembly over older models, that makes removal and replacement easier, as well as replacing any parts that wear out much simpler. So far it's been no problem in use. The edge sweeper is made of some kind of plastic or rubber compound. Roborock says that was because their experience with the bristle-type edge sweepers early on showed that the wore out or broke to rapidly. The ""cliff sensors"" and other parts of the unit are easily cleaned with a soft cloth. I'd only dampen the cloth with water or something like Windex if it was absolutely needed. A microfiber towel seems to work very well for us. Lastly, I cannot speak to it's rug-cleaning ability, although virtually every review we found for the Roborock models said that they did a great job on carpets. We simply haven't any on the floors to test it  on. I've already recommended this model to friends. I have no complaints with it, and only time will tell how well it stands up to use. So far, however, we like it very well, as it does an excellent cleaning job.","5.0","142"
"Mike D.","Color: Black","Very capable and complete robot vacuum","07 Sep 2020","The Roborock S6 Pure lives up to its advertising claims.  I have used it extensively for the past 2 month. Pluses: 1) The mapping and scheduling app works fine on my IOS devices.  Can select vacuum power, and number of passes in a job. 2) No Go Zones and Virtual Walls are easy to set up and accurate. 3) Battery life allows the S6 Pure to complete my entire house without having to recharge. 4) S6 Pure is reasonably quiet even on turbo mode (at least compared to my Roomba 985) 5) Easy to empty dust pin, easy to clean washable filter and plenty of bin capacity for my use. 6) No issues with my medium pile rugs (that defeated the Robobrock S4...although the Roomba 985 handles them well also) 6) Room cleaning and zone cleaning options in the IOS app work well.  My living room and hall get cleaned every other early morning very reliably. 7) Vacuum works fine in the dark.  LIDAR enables this.  Camera based robot vacuums struggle with this. 8) S6 Pure mapped my house accurately on the 1st pass. 9) Since I dock the S6 Pure under a butcher style table, the remote control on the app is handy for having the robot move out for maintenance (dust bin emptying, attaching mop, cleaning sensors and brush) rather than dragging it off its dock. 10) Connected to wi-fi on 1st try.  No issues with wi-fi coverage in my home. 11) Side brush does a good job getting close to walls which is where the S6 Pure starts its passes.  No issues with debris being flung around and left behind. Cons (pretty minor): 1) My version of the app doesn't let me ""name"" rooms.  I understand this is available in the Mi Home app but it doesn't specifically support the S6 Pure.  So I'm sticking with the official Roborock app.  My house isn't that big so room names would be a nice feature but aren't required.  I can tell the bedroom from the bathroom. 2) The mopping feature works but on the S6 Pure there is no option to stop the vacuum from mopping carpeted areas.  So, when the mop is attached, I option only zones that have hard floors.  That means that if there is carpet between two rooms with hard floors, the S6 Pure will need to be carried between rooms, unless I want my carpet mopped (which I don't). 3) S6 Pure stopped once (over a month ago) with the error message about a strong magnetic field in the middle of my bedroom.  Restart wasn't an issue.  Only happened once...maybe poltergeists? 4) Alexa integration only allows a limited number of commands.  For example: Can't tell the vacuum to clean a particular room. Comments:  No consumer robot vacuum has the suction power of a good upright vacuum so I view this and any other robot vacuum as good for frequent vacuuming but not as a true replacement for a more powerful upright. Conclusion:  I would buy this vacuum again.","5.0","125"
"Andrea Allred","Color: White","LOVE! Better than Shark IQ and iRobot i7","04 Dec 2020","Love this robot vacuum! I spent HOURS watching reviews for every brand out there. I found Vacuum Wars and Modern Castle the best sources. While I’d love to get the Roomba S9, I can’t justify the cost. On Black Friday I bought several models to try and this was by far the best over the Shark IQ with sled empty and Roomba i7. The power is great! It picked up 2 dust bins full after I ran the Shark. It’s quieter than the Shark too. The battery life is great. I can do the whole house, 1 level and about 1250 sq ft of cleaning area with 50% of the battery. The mop is simple. It doesn’t replace normal mopping but keeps it cleaned up and dust free between cleanings. The home mapping and app are great! I love the no go zones and lines to keep it off area rugs when I have the mop attached. I wish it would allow me to make 2 maps, one for vacuuming and one for mopping but when I did it got confused. It tried to start but because it had 2 maps of the same space it couldn’t position itself. I had to delete one map to have it work. So multi level mapping works but they have to be different layouts so it knows where it is. You can name rooms and order which rooms it cleans to help with efficiency too. I agonized over getting S6, S6 Pure or S6 MAXV. Pure is the lowest end of the series but differences are negligible. The S6 has a smaller water reservoir than Pure but slightly larger dust bin. S6 has 2 more sensors too and I believe it has no mapping zones which Pure does not have. The charging is also faster in the S6. But I really wanted the S6 MAXV. It has 2500 suction compared to 2000. The water reservoir is a lot bigger at 300ml compared to 140ml on S6 and 180ml on the Pure. MAXV also has electric water distribution instead of the gravity driven on the other models, but after using the mop on the Pure, it does well enough. MAXV is about $275 more than the Pure and didn’t feel like it had $275 more in features. The Pure does an amazing job. I’m hopeful the emptying bin technologies improve over the next couple of years because that is a game changer but they need some improvements to be worth the cost. Check out all the brands before buying. Some are better on various surfaces than others so you need to get one that is good for your home. Again, Vacuum Wars and Modern Castle had the best information IMO. The videos were better than the data sheets. Hope you find what works for your home!","5.0","119"
"Wesley Danger","Color: Black","Great tech at an amazing price","18 Oct 2020","I was able to pick up this vacuum on prime day for $399, or $200 off the normal list price. So far, I've run 4 full cycles in my multi-level home with great results. I'm going to break down my review into, what I think, are the most important things people look for in a robotic vacuum. Suction: As a dog owner, we wanted something that worked well picking up hair on both carpeted and wood floor surfaces. So far, it's done just as well as our stand-up vacuum at removing pet hair from these surfaces. The vacuum has a setting to automatically detect when it's on carpet and go into ""carpet mode"", which is essentially the highest power mode. After its first and 2nd cleanings, I was pleasantly surprised to see a mostly full dust cup and little to no traces of dog hair anywhere. Navigation: Since this vacuum has LIDAR, it will map out the area it is cleaning continually. The first time you run the vacuum, it does take extra long because it kind of splits your area into different zones while scanning. Don't worry, after it's mapped the entire area, the next time it vacuums it will be much more efficient. It will clean in a ""Z"" pattern instead of randomly bouncing around the room like some dumber robotic vacuums. My basement for example took 79 minutes to map and vacuum the first run, but only 50 the 2nd run because its pathing was much more efficient. If you have a multi-level home, you'll have to specify that in the app settings. Then when you have one floor completely mapped, you can ""add a map"" from the ""edit map"" menu and then your vacuum will map out the other area. It does a nice job avoiding obstacles as it also has a cliff sensor, a bump sensor, along with the LIDAR. It will dock automatically when done cleaning or if it needs to fill up on battery before finishing the cleaning routine. Battery: Since most of my house is carpeted, it's in carpet mode most of the time, which is essentially the ""max suction"" setting. The vacuum just this morning cleaned about 800sq feet and had 60% battery left when finished. If you have wood floors and run a lower power setting, you could easily stretch the battery to over 2000sq feet. Noise: Even at the max setting, the vacuum does not get very loud. I could have a normal volume conversation with someone with it running in the same room. If you want to have it run while you're sleeping, it does have a quiet mode, which I have to say, is pretty darn quiet. In the app you can also set a DND time where it will automatically pause any cleaning, turn off the AI voice, and dim the lights on the vacuum itself. App: The Roborock app has worked well for me so far. There are a plethora of settings to look at and personalize to your liking. You can do things like set schedules, edit the maps, remote control the vacuum, and much more. The map editor is pretty intuitive. You can set virtual invisible walls, split your areas into zones, customize how many times you want the vacuum to cover each zone, etc. The app tries its best to automatically create zones (rooms) by itself after mapping, but there is a manual way to merge and split areas if it doesn't do it correctly. Mopping: While I haven't tried the mopping yet, I will give a tip. When you have the mop attached with water, there is no way to toggle it on or off. If it's attached, it will attempt to mop. If you have a home like mine, my kitchen and dining area is wood floors, while the rest of my main floor is carpeted. I don't want water all over my carpet. So what you can do is create a ""zone"" in the map editor just for the wooded areas. When you set your vacuum to clean, you can tell it just to clean certain zones (they are color coded). That way, you don't have to worry about it trying to mop your carpet. Overall, a very solid vacuum so far. I will update my review if anything changes. Roborock has a strong track record with their vacuums all the way back to the S3. If you have a multi-level home and are looking to break into the robotic vacuum market, the Roborock S6 Pure is my recommendation to make that happen.","5.0","122"
"ashley","Color: Black","Welcome to the Jetsons... meet Rosie!","11 Jul 2020","This robot vacuum is awesome!  We bought this as a present for the the wife (I know... I know... but she insisted) and she gets gidy everytime this thing runs. We have two dogs and two little kids. As a result, she was vacuuming nearly every day which was taking a lot of time and hard to juggle with two little ones. This little vacuum runs every other night in the house now, only requiring a 30 second emptying of the collection bin the next day. It is quiet enough to run while the kids are asleep upstairs and does a great job! It goes places our regular vacuum would never fit.... places that made us wince the first time it did for fear of what it might find. We make sure and pick up the items on the floors so it doesnt get hung up. We also mainly have non-carpeted floors and thin rugs so we cant speak to how it does with thicker carpet. However, it seems to handle itself very well. We do have several transitions between floating floors and linoleum floors and it has zero issues there. It has only got stuck twice (a chord once and it actually managed to drive itself up on a dog bed the other time before it's front wheel couldn't manage to navigate off) and I would say the situations were understandable. The phone app is great, letting you partition out rooms and easily set no go zones and schedules. I would highly recommend this to anyone! For the price of a Dyson, you can have a vacuum that does the job for you!","5.0","101"
"Eddie","Color: Black","Moping or Performance, is it a choice? No!","02 Feb 2021","I ordered my first Roborock S6 pure in the fall of 2020, I loved it at first sight because it was such an upgrade from my old Proscenic 811 Gb who was a constant mess of irrational problems. But I noticed my S6 Pure’s mopping unit wouldn’t empty so it moped dry, I tried all the recommended tips on YouTube and company support but it wouldn’t work so I had Amazon replace the unit to a new one. The new one proved that the older one had an issue since the mop is now working amazing, but the problem now is that all which was working with the previous unit, is not working. For example I can only run on max, the app proposes a quiet , balanced and turbo mode as well but it only agrees to max and refuses to slow down and reduce noise in quiet mode. I am not even sure I am running on Max mode but I can guarantee that I am running on only one mode, (which is it?) I am so upset about that because I will have to exchange it again until I get the S6 Pure who actually works 100%. (Should I keep the mop unit since it works?!?) If these technical issues had not happened to the units I was delivered, I would say it’s the perfect vacuum and mop robot for price and function, but it’s annoying that in my case I have to return and get exchanges after a month because I don’t want to ignore important functionality issues since it is around a $600 investment. Over all I am going to stick with that brand because they look good and if not perfect yet they are probably better than other brands now in 2021. I saw many reviews and I think Roborock is the only one that has an intelligent mapping and reduces the need for long runs which allows battery to be used intelligently and the pattern the Roborock S6 Pure choses around the room is logical and almost human.","5.0","66"

It's very quiet and covers the entire floor.  I created a few no-go zones and 1 virtual wall (behind my entertainment center so it will go under, but not all the way to the cords) - all have worked perfectly.  I've tried the mopping feature a couple of times and it does a good ""wet sweep"" of the floor.  I bit annoying on this model, the water continually drips from the holes so you can't set up in advance.

"Simon","Color: Black","An apartment essential","09 May 2020","Very nice product. Although it was a pain to set up at first (my router was set to 5 GHz which wasn't supported), the instruction manual was very clear and the app was very helpful. I live in a small apartment and so far this has helped free up alot of time for me. The vacuum function is more than decent and, although I was hesitant about just using only water, mopping the floor left things looking pretty clean. The app has my entire house scheduled for cleaning for the entire week too which is very convenient! The reusable mop it comes with is easy to clean too! I also liked the maintenance page of the app that helps keep track of what needs changing. Overall, great design, relatively low noise (depending on the setting), fits into most corners, but still scares me every time it silently passes by :/ The fact that it's dual voltage also makes things convenient for me since I get a clean apartment and can give it to my parents (who live in a 220v zone) when I no longer need it. Well worth the money so far!","5.0","78"
"electrograv","Color: Black","Fantastic vacuum and mop robot with one flaw.","10 May 2020","The navigation and cleaning of this robot has been so far excellent, with only one exception: several times now, RoboRock’s new corner brush design has gotten terribly tangled up around thick carpets. Being made of some kind of rubber or polymer instead of traditional bristles was supposed to be designed to increase the longevity of the brush. I’m sure it does in most cases, but I have several thick rugs which for whatever reason cause the rubber side brush to wind around some of their hairs. Like a rubber band wrapped tightly, it’s impossible for the robot to get itself unstuck without intervention. In one case, it got so badly tangled that I had to unwind the rotor manually and the brush has been permanently damaged ever since. For example, my cheaper Roomba 960 does a much better job at avoiding getting stuck. I pretty much never have to do anything to babysit it. It just works, period — across a wide range of rug thicknesses, barriers, and obstacles. Of course, the newer RoboRock S6 is overall much smarter and has amazing mapping and app features the Roomba 960 doesn’t have, but it does have this small design issue so I can’t give the RoboRock 5 stars as-as. Note that this flaw will apply across any of the newer RoboRocks, since they pretty much all seem to have this new brush design. Fortunately, it looks like it’s possible to purchase replacement bushes that use traditional bristles instead of this rubber design. I believe it was a big mistake for RoboRock to release this new side brush design without more thorough testing on various types of floor rugs and matts, because otherwise it appears to be a fantastic vacuum robot. Even as-is, there are few other options that might be better. Even the Roomba S9 has serious hardware design flaws, for example: it utterly fails to navigate even a single rug I have, because it’s ground clearance was lowered far too much. The Roomba 960 remains the best overall that I have purchased so far in terms of intervention-free cleaning, but the mob ability this RoboRock has is not offered on any vacuuming Roomba unfortunately.","4.0","64"
"W.","Color: Black","Love Roborocks","18 Aug 2020","I've had the S4 since February and loved it, so when I moved it to the basement I needed a replacement for my main floor. I tried the Neato D7 for 3 weeks but had issues with it (see my review on that product page), and since I've only had good experiences with Roborock I went with the S6 Pure. I chose the S6 Pure over the S5 (old, doesn't have upgraded chipset), S5 Max (don't need advanced mop), and S6 (expensive), because it had a good balance of performance, features, and value. It was also on sale for $499 on 8/11/2020 which greatly affected my decision. The S4 always caught on edges of area rugs so the S6 Pure's higher chassis clears them with ease. The standard gravity-fed mop is a nice feature that I've used sparingly, and the laser navigation is second to none. I also can't get over how good the Roborock app is. It has so many great features that allow me to customize my robot and its schedule to fit my needs. The Neato app, by comparison, is much more simple and feature stripped. I've had my S6 Pure for a week so far and I can't image having issues. I highly recommend the S6 Pure!","5.0","88"
"Georgie Porgie","Color: Black","Good bot, but for the same money, buy the Roborock S6 over the S6 Pure.","12 Nov 2020","We own a S6, S4 and now this S6 Pure. As soon as we purchased the S6 Pure, the S4 was gifted to a family member. As far as cleaning, lidar scanning, suction, battery life, we do not see any difference. Now, on to the differences between the S6 and the S6 Pure. For starters, the S6 Pure only has two buttons (clean and home), while the S6 has three. You can only access the spot cleaning option via the app on the S6 Pure, very annoying. It is so much easier to just drop off the bot to the area and press spot clean than to navigate through the app and search for the buried option, point a spot on the saved map and tell it to go and spot clean. Also, while unboxing the unit, we discovered that it only had one reusable mop cloth, while the S6 had two, plus an additional three other cleaning pads. Last difference, the mop drip pad that came with the S6, it attaches to the dock and it stay secure fitted and it allows the dock to be repositioned at a later time with no issues. The drip pad that comes with the S6 Pure, it doesn't attach to the dock, but it has five adhesive patches that will secure it to the surface beneath. It doesn't allow for the dock to be repositioned. To summarize, it begs the question, why buy the S6 Pure when you can buy the S6 and get more value for your dollar, they were the same price (at the time of this review). -1 star because of those difference while being at the same price point. If it was $100-150 less than the S6, then it shouldn't be an issue.","4.0","30"

Thumbs up for suction power and vacuum. But, I am very much disappointed with mopping. The basic thing in mopping is to clear off the strains on the floor. This just swipes the entire floor with wet cloth and it doesn't apply any pressure to take out stains on the floor. After spending this much money, we expect it to put some pressure and mop. We still need to manually clean the floor every 2 weeks even after using Roborock. Hope the makers see this and come up with a holistic solution .","3.0","22"

"Integrity Reviews","Color: Black","Fatal Design Flaw","15 Dec 2020","My first impression of this after a couple days was very positive. Then I watched it roll over a piece of carpet fuzz, and the fuzz was still there when the robot moved on. I re-positioned the fuzz in front of the Roborock and watched it again roll right over it. So I next put the piece of fuzz directly in the center of the path and this time it picked it up. I looked around and found a few other small pieces of stuff on the carpet and repeated the experiment: the only time it picked-up anything larger than dust was when it was in the middle of the robot's cleaning path. The same was true on tile floors but with a little wider center-path tolerance. If you look at the first picture the problems become obvious: First, the suction hole over the cleaning brush is very small. So small it can be covered by three George Washington quarters! Second, the suction hole is located *above* the roller brush, so dirt has to be lifted vertically an inch or two. For a small battery powered vacuum, this is a big deal. To illustrate, compare the work required to push a friend's car, versus lifting the car an inch or two. I purchased a second robot vacuum, a Shark Vacmop Pro RV2001WD, with similar features to the Roborock S6 Pure. Look at the second photo showing the Shark suction hole. It was so large that quarters would fall through it, and it extended the entire width of the roller brush. (I have a separate review of the Shark unit and please read that if you are considering buying it.) I ran a performance test comparing the Roborock S6 Pure and the Shark Vacmop Pro RV2001WD. Both units were set to Maximum for the test. I had been using both units alternating days for a week before I started this test. In a single day I ran four cleaning cycles, Roborock-Shark-Roborock-Shark, one after the other, letting the batteries recharge before starting the second cleaning run. The results were shocking. I weighed the dirt in each vacuum's dust chamber using a bullion scale, weighing the chamber before and after vacuuming (they were both cleaned before each test). See the photos showing the dirt collected in each cleaning pass. Pass #1 Roborock: 2.6 grams Pass #2 Shark:  6.0 g Pass #3 Roborock: 1.3 g Pass #4 Shark:  3.0 g Even though the Shark cleaned immediately *after* the Roborock, in both cases the Shark pulled up over twice as much dirt as the Roborock did just beforehand!! I ran a third pair of passes the next morning and the pattern repeated (there was so little dirt in the Roborock that I couldn't weigh it). The difference is mostly due to the Shark suction hole being so much larger, and only having to sweep the dirt horizontally into the vacuum air stream (no vertical lifting of dirt). This is a design flaw with the Roborock that can't be overcome with a battery powered vacuum. Wall-powered vacuum cleaners generate huge amounts of vacuum compared to these robot-vacs, and the cleaning brushes are larger and driven by much stronger motors. On the positive side, the mapping function in the Roborock app is excellent (the Shark's is not). It is accurate, easy to use, and was good at detecting/avoiding objects/obstacles. Setting up no-go areas and invisible walls was straight-forward and worked well. The large battery size is a plus and could clean my home using about half the battery capacity. The dirt chamber is easy to clean (even though there wasn't much in it). The air filter is supposed to be washable but I won't have the unit long enough to find out. I summary, the Roborock S6 Pure has excellent software but with fatal flaws in the hardware design.","1.0","32"

Nothing seemed to help. I tried everything CustomerService told me to do and it did not help. I removed the roller brush and discovered a 1/4” tear in a rubber piece that was directly underneath the brush unit. I would guess that was why I was getting the error. They asked for pictures which I sent them. Customer service recommended that I send it to their repair center and it usually takes less than a week to complete the repair after the device is received. They worked with me and I sent it in for repair and when they received it they repaired it the same day and shipped it back. They replaced the internal fan and filer. At first I had a very bad impression of this company but they came through with flying colors. I Love the way this vacuum has a great app that maps out your house and you can select where to vacuum. The mopping feature works great. I purchased more mopping pads and filers so that I can change them often. I am very pleased with this vacuum and company.","5.0","18"
"Taylor","Color: Black","1st Vacuum defective out of box, Replacement was USED!!!!","31 Jul 2020","Ordered this vacuum last week, first vacuum came and made an awful grinding / whining noise out of the box. When it his carpet, *flat like carpet in an airport* the brush would stop working and it would go from carpet boost to normal. Every 10 seconds or so it would increase suction make this grinding noise and then you can hear the brush stop and it would just repeat this cycle. I took the side brush off, the main brush out and it still made this noise which based on the manufactures website it means something is wrong inside. I spoke with an amazon rep over the phone less than 6 hours after receiving the first vacuum and they sent me out a replacement and sent me a return label. Today less than an hour ago I received a used vacuum with dirt in dust bin, and hair in rollers and brush. The box was all taped up with packing tape and the electronics inside weren't in their plastic. The vacuum was wrapped loosely in a dirty plastic cover and the mopping pad is dirty as well. Absolutely disgusting especially during COVID!!!!! Now I have to return this 2nd vacuum and re order another one for $500.00 while a wait a week for my refund as well as clean my kitchen from all of the crud that has fallen out of this box and vacuum while unpacking it (someone else's hair and dirt) YUCKKKK!!!!!!!!! I typically would just call it quits and find another manufacture but I have friends who have this exact vacuum and LOVE it, along with the many many youtube videos I have watched saying these are the best. GET IT TOGETHER ROBOROCK!!!!! I am placing an order for another one right this second and If it comes like the last 2 I will just give up and update this review again.","1.0","53"
"Fletcher","Color: Black","This is an amazing robot, a pretty good vacuum, and a terrible mop.","27 Oct 2020","Overall, I am incredibly impressed with this robot's abillity to navigate in my house. I have it run every night at 2:30 in the morning, and it's quiet enough that it doesn't disturb anyone, and then I empty it in the morning. The fact that it can run every night makes up for the fact that it is not a supremely powerful vacuum. It is not going to replace a Dyson in the suction department. Its ability to navigate and get around obstacles and make its way back to the base is really, really impressive. Its movement path tends to be very effective and efficient, and it vacuums the entire downstairs of my house in just about an hour. The robot makes its own maps of the house, which I can then divide into areas and annotate with room names, and it will update these maps as objects move around. It handles change very impressively. The maintenance stuff is pretty simple. It seems to have a pretty well-designed brush and roller system so that even if it did get caught up with animal hair or string or something, it hasn't included tool for cutting that stuff out, and the beater bar is easily accessible and removable. Also, the robot has very specific error messages that are very accurate, so it will say that it's thinks something is caught up in a brush, or that it can't move because of wheel is off the ground, or some sensor is dirty. It's not at all like those messages that seem to be everywhere now in technology that just announce that something went wrong, with no further information. However, if you're looking at this for its mopping function, know these things ahead of time. One, the mop function is no more sophisticated than the robot dragging what is essentially a wet washcloth behind it while it goes over a given surface. And that you must manually add and remove the mop cartridge for the given area you want to mop. That is, it cannot turn mopping on and off, and in fact is not aware at all that it even has the mop attached. The mop cartridge itself is a water tank that has something like a washcloth velcroed to the bottom. It dribbles water from the tank onto the washcloth, but in reality, this washcloth is barely damp in the locations where the water is supposed to be coming out, and you can see that when the robot is supposedly mopping, it's not even wet on the floor behind it. This is with the tank set to the high water flow setting. There is also no action involved with the mop, like it doing any scrubbing, and you are forbidden from putting any kind of cleaning product into the tank, so it really is just plain water being dragged on a maybe damp washcloth. At best, this will pick up dust, and some dirt, but not much else. Also, while the weaker vacuuming is made up for by the fact that I can run it automatically every night, since the mop is a manual intervention operation, I can't use frequent repetition to make up for the crummy mopping. As it is now, when I want to mop, I spray pretreatment on to anything I see on the floor that looks like it's not going to budge, then I have to make the robot go into the kitchen, then I wet the washcloth part of the water tank in the sink, attach the water tank, tell the robot to clean that one room, and then catch the robot before it goes back to the base which is on carpet, so I can remove the water tank, not like it actually makes the carpet wet at all. The most evidence I have usually that the floor was mopped is the fact that the washcloth on the water tank looks somewhat dirty.","5.0","9"
"Robert Jay","Color: Black","The only Robo Vacuum Cleaner I liked!","20 May 2020","When the pandemic and stay at home orders hit, my wife wanted me to vacuum the house. I immediately started looking for Robo Cleaners. Over the past six weeks, I have tried four different models. It was something I did not like about each of the first three. I have a two story house with an elevated entry level that Robot cleaners cannot climb up to. That means I have in effect three floors on the house. In spite of promises, none of the other three could map and retain the maps for more than one floor at a time. The S6 pure can. Also, the S6 maps using a laser guidance system, not a camera. I think it may be more accurate in navigating and finding things, and of course could do the job in total darkness since lasers don’t need the lights on to work. This mapping function actually divides the floor into multiple rooms, this is a function I had to perform manually on other models I tested. If one wants to of course one can of further combine or divide the rooms or set the boundaries anywhere you want manually. One thing I miss on this model that other models that is that other models allowed you to label the names of the room, where is this as he does not. This may be improved on a future software update. However, I can still figure out which is the living room and which is the dining room on the map it draws. We have oriental rugs in some of the rooms. One of the other cleaners I tried promptly chewed up the fringes on the rug and curled it off. It sucked it into its apparatus and stopped and I had to freeze it. No matter what I tried to do or how low I placed the strings, , it constantly choked and had to be rescued every time it crossed the border of the oriental rug. (That one was returned in about two days.) The S6 nibbles the fringes a bit, but passes all of them OK. My wife did not like even that. On previous models, some allowed exclusion zones or no cross lines. This did not work. The no cross line did not work, because I want the vacuum to work on both sides of the line rather than just walling off a corner of the room. One of the other cleaners allowed you to map off a non-entry area. When I tried, the minimum width was something like 6 feet, which was way too large to use just on a fringe of an oriental carpet. Finally I tried the S-6 Pure. This is a brand new model from this company. I usually don’t like to buy things just as they are released, but the clock was ticking and I had no choice. However, I am extremely pleased with the product. As I said, it is brand new so I assume that everything is as up-to-date and improved as possible. It does indeed map more than one floor, and it has map three floors in my house. It has also made a pretty good guess as to how to divide all the rooms on the floor. These are modifiable if you wish. As I said, so far you cannot label the rooms, but that is not really necessary. I tried the no-go zone on this one. Unlike the other cleaner I try it, this cleaner allows a no go zone of perhaps 1 foot in width. This is perfect for the fringes on the carpet. I selected a no go zone around the fringes of the oriental rug and let the cleaner loose. One was pretty much perfect and one just nipple devoid of a little bit. I adjusted the border of the no go zone to include completely the fringes. Now the robot zooms around the living room but avoids the fringes of the oriental rug. I also set little no go zones around the vents which are on the floor in this room, so that the Robot cleaner does not go over the metal grating. This cleaner also has an option, which I have not tried yet, where it will vacuum at a lower strength on hard floors, but will sense when it is on a carpet or rug and increase the vacuum strength to vacuum these areas more heavily. This unit will also mop floors, obviously just smooth non-carpeted floors, but I really did not care about this function (though it is nice to have!). I am glad it is there because it might be of some use in the future, especially for kitchen and bathrooms. This unit has the largest battery size of the various sizes that are available in different manufacturers machines, so they charge more to list out as long as anybody else’s. It also has a vacuum setting which is among the strongest of the ones available in different models you might find. One additional thing I should say is that their customer service appears to be excellent. I have emailed them multiple times with various dumb questions, and I usually get a response within a day. Another nice thing is that they actually appear to read my question and do not give a boilerplate response. This is not the cheapest Robo vacuum cleaner on the market (not the most expensive), but if these features sound interesting to you, I have not found another cleaner even at a higher price that is it’s equal.","5.0","17"
"R. Foster","Color: Black","One flaw...... and an update","28 Aug 2020","Generally a pretty good machine, however there is a flaw. I have an area rug with geometric patterns, some areas are black. The sensors on the vacuum see this as a cliff, and turns it away. There is no way to turn off the sensors, even though my vacuum is used on the bottom floor, and there is no drops. So this vacuum won’t do the whole floor, which kind of makes it useless. Update: After this review, Roborock contacted me for details, I sent them a reply with a picture of the carpet, and told them that I had tried the tape over sensors work around, and got an error message. They sent me a reply, and asked me to try to put tape over the sensors, ummmmm, I just said that I tried that. Now they have sent me 2 emails saying that they provided me with a fix (I just said that it didn't work, do you read?). and asked me to change my rating, and even offered me $30 to change it. I wonder how many of their high ratings are a result of a $30 payment. Sorry Roborock, not being able to turn off those sensors is a design flaw, and $30 won't make me change my rating.","2.0","8"
"Verth","Color: Black","Does just ok... could be better.","07 Sep 2020","*edit note* had to knock it down 2 stars because this thing barely cleans well now, I've been maintaining it but the suction is just poor, go with a shark vacuum or iRobot... as soon as I get some money I'm going back to a Roomba, this thing is garbage. So I've only owned 2 robot vacuum cleaners in my life, first was a roomba  (can't remember the model, came out around 2016 200-300$ area) and this one, I loved my Roomba but my complaint was it was loud and it just played bumper cars with my walls and that is how it cleaned, so I vowed .y next one would be smarter, quite, better... well I got some of that with this one. First thing it does well is once it figures out the room lay out it starts to clean in sections and a back and forth cleaning pattern, does super well on that one. No complaints on this front. Dust bin size... it is tiny!!!!!! I had a bigger dust bin on my old roomba, this is laughable, I have to empty the bin for every room, bin size I am not impressed with. Suction.... oh man... uhhh well... it isn't the best but it is on par with how my Roomba cleaned, hard wood floors and tile, amazing job, carpets... ehhh.. handheld do a way better job, but this machine will rev up its sectioning power to meet the demands of the area it is cleaning. Noise, well on this one this is quieter, now by quieter I don't mean by a lot, it is noticeable if you were to run one then the other but it will wake you if you were to run it while you were sleeping. App, this to me is where this one shines a bit more, the App for this machine is really nice, Roomba could learn a thing or two from them. Maintaining this is pretty much the same as a Roomba, you're going to have to clean the brushes and rollers and wheels frequently, especially if you have pets. Overall I couldn't give this a 5 star because that bin size is atrocious, for the amount you pay for this the bin should be bigger, I could have gone for the more expensive models but come on, should not have to pay 700 for a machine with a bigger bin.","1.0","6"

"J. D","Color: White","Simply amazing and what an intelligent device should be","04 Feb 2021","I have / had an IRobot I5. Everyday it would get stuck somewhere and run into things at full steam. For something ""intelligent"" it seemed to be pretty random in it's AI. Don't even get me started on the latency in my Alexa gear talking to the vacuum - it's horrific. Enter my Roborock S6. Setup was a breeze. On day one, it happily roamed around my house using LIDAR to map the whole place, not getting stuck once. The mapping capabilities are simply mindblowing for a unit at this price point. It methodically cleans in a pattern (the iRobot, just bounced around like a pinball). When it detects it is closing on an object, it slows down as to not plow into it at full speed and mark your baseboards, furniture, and feet. It will navigate around ""temporary"" obstacles with ease (like shoes) and not inhale the laces like my iRobot did (it once devoured a cat toy, boy was that fun to extricate). My iRobot would get confused by any carpet that had a pattern that included a black area thinking it ""was at the edge of a cliff"". The Roborock has no such issue.  When it detects it is on carpet, the suction ramps up, and when it goes back on to hard floors it drops. That means it's quieter, except when it needs to be. The app has very low latency and the only issue I have had with it is when I tell Alexa to interface with it, Alexa will sometimes announce the command in addition to sending it to the unit. One nice feature of the app is the ability to create ""zones"" like ""kitchen"" and you can tell the vacuum to just run to that area and clean it.  If I *had* to find one con with this device, it would be that, unlike my iRobot, it doesn't have a handle on top to pick it up, you have to pick it up from the sides. Seriously - that's the worst thing I can say about it. Buy it - you won't regret it.","5.0","18"
"Graeme Biggs","Color: Black","Great Vacuum, OK Mop","08 Jun 2020","This vacuum does a great job if you just need a vacuum. The mapping feature works great and I like the ability to schedule certain rooms on certain days. And of course the vacuum does a great job on everything you can throw at it. It is a huge upgrade from my last robot, which just drove in a random direction until it hit something. One of the features that pushed me towards the S6 Pure over the competition was the addition of the mop. While I think the mop does a great job for what it is (a wet microfiber cloth), It is difficult in a house that does not have distinct carpet or hard surface ""rooms."" MY house is all hard surface flooring with area rugs. The vacuum does not know when it hits carpet or when the mop is attached. I was able to get around the mopping rugs/carpets problem by spending a few hours partitioning the areas with rugs as separate rooms and when mopping, only select the ""rooms"" that are the areas without rugs.","4.0","6"

Navigates perfectly after first wk of learning, doesn't bump into things but also fits into or under places I never expected.  It also mops but I haven't used it in the month I've had it. Wanted to make sure it works first but if anything like vacuum it will likely impress me.  I was going to splurge and buy a self empty one but to be honest as long as you remember 1-2x a day it works great. My sister has a more recognizable and pricey robotic vac and wellllll she is purchasing this one.  It's better and definitely better VALUE. Didn't put 5 star because I'd like more options on app and for it to know which rooms have carpet so it doesn't mop those if I were to forget to schedule that room as no go.","4.0","3"

"Sean S.","Color: Black","Damaged + Very Noisy + Very low suction power","09 May 2020","Update: 05-19-2020 Upon updating the firmware it fixed the suction power issue, Also would like to point out excellent customer service by Roborock, They reached out to me and assured if there was anything wrong with the unit they will exchange it with no hassle. Glad to hear company stands behind their product. it’s too loud and suction is not any good. I am really disappointed as I spent several hours and watched so many videos and this was the recommended product by all the reviewers on YouTube but it doesn’t even come close to the cheapest Eufy model. I followed all settings to and reseted the unit several times but when I try to change the mode to turbo or max regardless of selection it stays on balanced suction power. The mop also doesn’t function on these new model and that is other reason why I had purchased this model. Really disappointed.","4.0","4"
"ANamas","Color: White","Nice navigation & Mapping; Decent vacuum; Poor battery life & Horrible Charging time","30 Sep 2020","Headline tells it all.. Positive are excellent navigation and mapping. Truely amazing technology. It is a decent vacuum, no complaints there. always picks up something :). The main complaint is battery life. It is nowhere close to the advertised 180 mins running time. I am getting approx. 100 mins for 100% to 20% battery, which equates to total 125 mins running time. This is in balanced mode. Vacuum also takes forever to charge. To go from 20% to 80% and resume cleaning, it takes more than 5 hours. I am very much intrigued by the potential, but battery life makes be to debate whether to return the vacuum. Update 10/02 - Positives first - The more I use the vacuum, I am very impressed by the mapping/navigation capability. The way it navigates around the house, from room to room is simply amazing. I am impressed. Now coming to negatives - Battery life and charging time in-short is horrible. Dealing with Roborock support is very frustrating and time consuming. It is only through emails. Even if you call them, the subsequent communication happens via email and very slow. Attached screenshot of email communications from Roborock regarding battery life. Right now (after 2 weeks of purchase), I am constantly getting 100 mins of running time for battery to go from 100% to 20%. After which it goes back to charging station to charge for 5-6 hours. I ran the vacuum in balanced mode. Running time is nothing close to 180 mins. There is absolutely no way to use this continuously for the advertised 180 mins running time. Even if I consider that it means 180 mins for 100% battery life, I should be getting 145 mins for 80% of battery use. I am getting 30% less. THIS IS FALSE ADVERTISING! I am reducing my rating after dealing with Roborock support and Battery issues. I am continuing to work with RoboRock and will provide update as soon as I have it. Update 10/13 - I have increasing my rating to 3 stars after dealing with customer support. I ended up returning the product and went with S5 Max as per support's recommendation","3.0","3"
"heyDuh","Color: Black","Easily the best *Vaccuum* and i've owned quite a few","20 Jan 2021","The journey for the perfect bot began with the Roomba i4. For its time, a great machine. however, it mapped the house but I could do nothing with the map - no selective cleaning etc. Then came the roomba i7. It maps, one can ask it to clean specific rooms etc. however, it has a BIG issue - it cannot ""See"" in the dark. This meant, leaving all lights on for the nightly cleaning ritual in specific rooms of the house. Finally came the S6 - godsend. I love this baby. It does everything the i7 does and much more - cleaning by zone, by literally a SPOT, rooms etc. is a breeze. The machine has multiple levels of suction and  its a boon - we can clean even with kids in their virtual classrooms!. I also love the bigger filter baskets. Requires fewer trips to the trash can. The robot is smart, works around ""new"" obstacles, cleans really -- i mean really well even on a medium power setting. We don't have many carpets except a few tiny rugs and its been good with them thus far. It also does better than the room with the little side brush - it does not ""Grab"" as much hair but rather spreads it out so the vac can pick em up. Now to the issues - notice i always call it a ""vac"". it apparently has a mopper but its honestly garbage. it does not work. if you are dreaming of gleaming, clean + mopped floors, then well..dream on! It also has a brush that does get tangled way more than the roomba. The nastiest of all is when you let the robot learn the house but then have to break up the rooms into zones. Its really quirky. You have add MANY dividers and then merge to avoid the app from blowing up. its hard to explain but once you try you will know. I would have loved to splurge / try the MAX especially with its newer mopper / camera but i've blown enough on this that i may give the Max a pass. I hope this helped!!","3.0","2"
"lizhaoyan","Color: Black","Very good and smart robot with some improvement needed","04 Aug 2020","Overall I liked this product pretty much. I have a little one crawling all days and It frees my hand from daily mopping and vacuuming, especially during this pandemic time. People stays home most of time. It’s very smart when working with the app. I liked the room support feature and virtual wall which saves me lots of time, because the kitchen needs to clean everyday while other rooms doesn’t. It’s just couple click on the screen so it knows where to clean. There’s a small issue with the mopping. When the robot go thru. edge of the room, it actually can’t reach the very end of that line. My cleaning standards are pretty high so I will still need to manually mop that small part like every other week or so. The only issue for S6 pure compared with S6 in mopping feature is that the plastic piece, which be used to attach a disposable mopping cloth, is not compatible with the PURE’s water tank because it blocks the air inlet of the tank. If you look closer to the PURE and s6 tank, you will find the air inlet location is not the same. So the S6 could work perfect with disposable cloth while the PURE could not. But this issue is not bothering me so much since the reusable mop cloth is very light and easy to clean. I can stand using the reusable ones before the updated compatible version is been developed and released on market. One last thing I want to talk about is the multi floor mapping feature. S6 Pure has the support for multi floor mapping, but you will need to bring the charger/base together with the machine to a new level and let the machine always start from the base. Otherwise it may cause confusion to the data and current map might be overwritten (you don’t want to see this happen because you will have to remap that floor and all your rooms or virtual wall setting will be erased)","4.0","4"
"Filbertnut","Color: Black","Best Purchase I Ever Made!","15 Jul 2021","I have 2 dogs, 1 hubbie (thankfully...haha), plus my 80 year old mother lives with me in a 2 story house with hardwood floors throughout.  Spills, nose drips, water spots, dog hair, etc. are a daily occurence.  Plus I live in the desert, which leaves a layer of dirt on everything as well.  With caregiving duties for my mom and a dog with seizures, I never have time to clean the floors, and I could only afford to hire housecleaning services a few times a year.  So, on Amazon Prime Day I finally decided I needed help and purchased Roborock S6 Pure Robot Vacuum and Mop.  BEST DECISION EVER!  My floors have never looked this good.  They shine for days, and when it's time for another vacuum and cleaning, its easy peasy now that the robot has done a floor map of my 1st and 2nd floors.  I would recommend buying extra mopping pads.  Since my floors are so dirty, I sometimes change out the pad half way through due to our dirty floors.  I've never owned a robot vacuum cleaner before so I can't do a comparison, but I do love the results from Roborock. Update: For those wondering how to update your maps, roborock did it automatically. I just opened doors that I had closed and at the end of its cleaning roborock went to the now open room, added the room to my existing map,  and cleaned it. Easy Peasy!","5.0","1"
"Jennifer Johnson","Color: Black","Does exactly as described","01 Aug 2021","I researched robot vacuums for wks by reading reviews, watching videos, asking around, etc. I chose the S6 pure bc of the great reviews and features it provides. I was just tired of my feet feeling dirty everyday when I was sweeping constantly (we have rugs but no carpet in the entire house) and using the swiffer mop about every other day. I set the robovac to clean every night at 7pm. We make sure there's nothing that can get sucked up and it does its thing. It leaves a crumb or something here and there but I don't expect it to deep clean like I would. It does its job in about 45 min for about 900 or so sf of the house. Battery drains pretty quickly for something that takes so long to charge but that's not really an issue with our small house. I also wanted something that would clean under the beds and this does it with ease. The maps are accurate, suction power on the balanced setting is good, and it stays out of the no go zones. I had to make my son's rug a no go zone because its like shag carpet and the robovac gets stuck when it tries to turn. Overall I'm very happy. If it lasts 5 or more years I'll know I made a good choice but its already proving it was worth the price.","5.0","1"
"James H. Green","Color: Black","more trouble than it's worth","14 Jan 2021","This device has a great deal of unrealized potential. Its problem seems to largely lie in the software. The documentation is so sketchy that it’s difficult to determine whether the deficiencies are in the apps or in software internal to the machine, i.e., its operating system. I’ll start with the apps. The “manual” that comes with the system provides two sources for apps, MI Home and Roborock, which can be downloaded from Apple and Google for iPhone and Android. I had a great deal of difficulty getting these to work, some of that my problem. In the process I learned from Roborock’s technical support that the software doesn’t work on tablets, so I used an Android cell phone. but would have much preferred to have used my iPad. The app is the least intuitive I’ve seen, and the manual is of little assistance. My first runs were the device on its own without using the app. It does an amazingly good job of finding its way around obstacles, and the vacuum is quite good, but it’s apparent that it needs guidance. After I got everything linked to my Wi-Fi, I decided to try the device in a single room rather than having it wander through the house. I closed the the living room/dining room, which is about 40’ x 20’ and turned it loose. The device moved off the docking station and started on the adjacent wall, which is occupied by a baby grand piano. It navigated around the legs and did a good job of following the wall, turned the corner, and started down the next side of the room. This has a fireplace with a marble hearth that is faced with a carpet about ½ inch thick. The device wandered off the carpet and couldn’t climb out. It meandered back and forth and finally signaled that it needed help. I lifted it out and set it down, pushed the start button, and it went back to the docking station and started over again. It retraced that path four times, and hung up in the hearth each time, obviously having learned nothing. I managed to keep it away from the hearth and it finished vacuuming, and did a very good job of covering everything. It got hung up once on the dining room table and once trying to climb a pedestal base of an end table. It drew a map of the room, but that was when I discovered it hadn’t been saving the map, something that was apparently no longer possible without repeating the whole mapping process again. It isn’t clear from the documentation whether the mapping is saved in the device, in the app, or in a cloud. Two or three times the app told me that it couldn’t connect to the Internet even though other apps on the phone were connected, but why does it need to? Do I want a detailed map of my house posted somewhere on the Internet? I’ll skip over the rest of my experience and summarize. It’s fascinating to watch this device navigate. It is a decent vacuum cleaner that falls far short of its capabilities. I think most of the problem can be fixed with software and documentation, both of which are far below a reasonable commercial grade. I had hoped to connect it through Alexa and give it verbal instructions to clean specific rooms. It’s now clear that this can’t be made to work today. The only way to make the app work that I could find is to punch sparsely labeled buttons and see what happens. I think in its present condition this device is about at the beta test level. For me it’s more trouble than it’s worth.","2.0","1"
"Audrey","Color: Black","Brilliantly Smart Vac","29 Jan 2021","This is my 3rd go at having a smart vacuum. My first one was the Bissel, one of those not-so-smart botvacs that just did random cleaning. It was unimpressive and then was replaced by Neato's D3 connected. I had that one for 3 years before getting tired of the robot vac getting dumber over time and being so loud. This botvac isn't much more quiet than the Neato, and is much louder than my ex's Eufy, however, that's my only complaint. The mapping is updated every time it runs, so you don't have to worry about getting a perfect mapping run, and if you move furniture, it will adapt to that. Being able to schedule cleaning of a certain room or area is incredibly efficient. I have my two bedrooms, living room, kitchen, and bathroom all divided into separate rooms so each is on it's own scheduled cleaning (Bath and beds on certain days, kitchen on another, etc...), but if I made a mess in the kitchen, I can have just that done without babysitting it. The washable filter, easy to empty dust bin, and ability to lightly mop while it vacuums are all huge benefits with this botvac. Pros: - Constantly updates it's map, and able to have multiple floors mapped. - Receives software updates and is easy to update - Dust bin cleans easily and filter is washable - Able to lightly mop (not scrub, but no mop vacs can) and uses washable mop heads - Scheduled room specific cleaning is a godsend - Cleans very efficiently, and thus quickly. Twice as fast as my Neato Botvac was, with 3x the battery life to boot Cons: - Loud, probably around 53db. Slightly more quiet than the Neato Botvac, but louder than Eufy.","5.0","1"
"Peter","Color: Black","Disappointed","01 Jun 2020","It worked great at first, but kept getting clogged with pet hair. I couldn't get it to clean a single floor with emptying the filter 2 or 3 times yet the filter wasn't full, it was just bunched up in the center. Then it ran over something sticky, gathering my kids dropped gum or maybe a shoe tracked in sap, which got into the wheel mechanism and now it can't move at all. Granted it's no the vacuum's fault but there's no way for me to clean that area out and I can't find a replacement part. So $550 vacuum is unusable in less than a year. Also I can't tell you how many times it would get stuck on things. Also the replacement components are overpriced. It's back to regular vacuum.","2.0","5"
"Nicholas","Color: Black","magnetic field error crippled an otherwise incredible product","26 Jun 2020","TL;DR an otherwise amazing high quality machine that is crippled by a persistent “encountered magnetic field” error near refrigerator and other random places in apartment that renders it useless in much needed areas of the household I had this robot for about 3 days but had to return. In my apartment, the robot would be inoperable in multiple areas of my apartment due to persistent “encountered magnetic field” error. This error renders the bot useless near refrigerators and bundles of electrical cords (eg under or near your desk). It wouldn’t clean large portions of my kitchen due to this error which obviously was a huge problem, and the support staff basically told me that my apartment was incompatible with this and all their other models of the machine due to these magnetic fields. Apparently this is a problem with their whole series and when pushed on the subject, the support staff suggested that there is no fix or even attempt to fix this problem from a design perspective. The worse part is that I don’t need magnetic barrier strips bc i live in a one floor apartment, so don’t even need the ability to detect magnetic fields and there’s no option to turn this detection feature off. Other than this huge problem, the bot worked flawlessly. The combined mopping feature is a huge plus, and being able to map out no-go zones was easy and intuitive. The scheduler on the app needs some work, but if not for this magnetic field issue, i’d be extremely happy with this robot. the return and refund is on its way, but i would’ve liked this robot to work for me. too bad","2.0","3"
"z1572","Color: Black","Excellent Mapping Feature and Doesn't Get Lost Like Others","06 Jan 2021","We upgraded from an older model of a Roborock vacuum and the difference is NIGHT AND DAY. The Roborock S6 Pure makes it back to the dock every single time.  It doesn't bump into furniture and walls.  It doesn't get stuck in silly places or wedge itself halfway underneath the dresser.  It also doesn't get lost on its return to the dock and die underneath our bed... even though the dock was in a completely different room. The mapping feature is fantastic in the app.  The invisible walls are fantastic in the app.  Super easy to have the robot vacuum clean a specific room or just a small area of the room. The ""mopping"" feature... eh.  That feature is more like dragging a damp cloth around on the floor.  It's fine enough for really light cleaning on hard surfaces, but was disappointed that this feature of the robot vacuum performed the same as the older model. Overall, happy with the purchase and value.  To be fair though, we bought this on Prime Day and saved 40% which made the purchase easier to justify.  I'm not sure I'd spend the full retail price on any robot vacuum, but for the price we paid for the Roborock S6 Pure, I am very happy with results.","4.0","1"

Have to touch up with my cordless vacuum","01 Dec 2020","The mapping and intelligence of this vacuum seems pretty good..but that is useless if it doesn’t clean well. The suction needs to be much stronger! On carpet it does not seem like it’s been vacuumed… With a regular vacuum you can tell it has been fluffed up a little bit and feels cleaner whereas this looks and feels the exact same after vacuuming. On hard floor, it seems to do better. However,  today it missed a ton! It would miss it right between the carpet and hardwood floor and between the hardwood floor and our little kitchen mats. It actually seem to be depositing crumbs there on all the borders. I had already emptied the dustpan and I had the vacuum go over it 3 times to see if it would eventually get the crumbs. It went right over them as if there was no suction at all and never picked them up after all 3 tries! That is pointless when I have to touch up with my Dyson. I will likely be returning this.","2.0","2"

"Katie Bergsten","Color: Black","Great Product.","18 Aug 2020","This is my first robot vacuum so I can’t compare it.  With that said, I did a ton of research and I couldn’t find a vacuum with better reviews than the Roborock series.  I went with this one because it was $100 dollars off and only $30 more than the S5. Suction- Great on hard surfaces, good on carpet. Brush- Impressive- rarely gets hair wrapped around it. Collection bin- Easy to remove and clean. Mop- Suprisingly good.  I zone my kitchen in the app so that it goes over it 3 times and it does a very impressive job. Comparable to a swiffer. Navigation- Wow.  Just as good as people reported.  I am beyond impressed. The App- I learned it in no time.  I used the Mi Home app because the Roborock app had a hard time finding my internet connection. Overall this has been a game changer.  I have read that robot vacuums can have a shorter shelf life so I bought the 3 year extended warranty on top of the 1 year manufacture warranty.  That was $70, but it gives me piece of mind that this will work for the next 4 years.  We run it twice a day.  Have a two level home.  Works great and automatically recognizes the second level.  With COVID-19 our kids are at home all day and my wife loves that she can go up stairs and run the vacuum while she gets the kids started on school.  I rarely review a product and I have been more then impressed with this one.  It truly saves us time, and having freshly mopped and vacuumed floors makes you feel like life is not as crazy as it really is. Questions I had that are answered? Can I name rooms and only run it in one room?  Yes!  And it works great and is accurate.  You can also do a series of rooms. Does the mop recognize carpet?  No.  But, I mapped out the rooms with carpet and hard floors and it is no problem to run just the hard floors with the mop. Zones?  What are they?  You can select a zone and have the robot vacuum or mop that zone multiple times. Noise?  Yes, you can hear it.  Not annoying but I can hear it down stairs when I am up stairs.  I can also watch TV in the same room while it is running. Quality and Build?  Seems very high quality. Cons- More suction on carpet would be nice but it still does a great job.  The app took a little time to learn.  Replacement pads, brushes, etc are available but a little $$$.  You can get knock off replacement parts but I haven’t bought them because the reviews are mixed and the original parts seem very high quality.  With that said, if you replace the brush, the filter and the pads you are looking at $70. Summary- I am very pleased with this purchase.","5.0","10"
"Florida Gal","Color: White","Former Roomba user loves new Roborock","13 Aug 2021","Because of all the technology associated with this robot it can seem intimidating to set up at first. I encourage anyone who purchases it to take their time with the first clean and set up a clear footprint for a thorough first clean/first scan. Once that is done the app makes it quite easy to set up scheduling and cleaning of certain rooms. I am a former iRobot owner I have owned three or four (since the inception of robotic vacuuming) and although the Roomba is durable, and parts are easy to get, I find the technology in this Roborock far superior.  It is respectful of my furniture, baseboards and last minute obstacles (like the laundry basket that wasn't there yesterday) and seems to be quite adept (I'd grade it at a 98-99%) at recovering from tangles, being wedged in or pegged in, or getting stuck. Maybe it learns from past errors? I'm not sure, but I do know that it cleans very, very effectively, the app is simple to use, and the sound of the robot running is a moderate to low-moderate level. I have not utilized the mopping function yet. I am an Android user and I find the roborock app very effective and foolproof vs the MiHome app. I do not use voice commands via my Google home, although I am able. Yes, there are lots of reviews and reviewers, but I feel that because I have 10+ years of experience with robotic vacuuming and vacuums I can very confidently recommend the Roborock across the board. I don't see any weaknesses in the design or functionality. Keep in mind, I don't mind opening the dust bin and emptying it on a regular basis (do this outside because the Roborock picks up the finest particles that will just poof all over you and the air around you when you empty the bin) bc it's slightly satisfying to see how much it picks up even tho I run it EVERY DAY. Additionally, I haven't used the mopping function, and it may be a superfluous feature (but can't say until I've given it a go). I really like the sleek look of the white unit as well. I was worried it would show scuffs or wear, but that's not the case at all. Buy it, and then watch Disney's movie, ""Wall-E"", and then you'll  understand what I'm talking about.","5.0","1"

"J. Hartwell","Color: Black","Great with some annoying flaws","09 Jan 2021","I've had this vacuum for about 2 months now and overall it's great. Suction is good, it obviously won't get everything out of higher pile carpets but that shouldn't be expected. The mapping and lidar functionality is amazing. Being able to create barriers and no go zones in the app is such a game changer. There are 3 big areas for improvement that they SHOULD be able to fix with firmware. Kind of confuses me as to why they haven't. 1. If the vacuum gets knocked off it's base even slightly, which my dogs will frequently cause, it won't redock itself and will basically go into a shutdown mode. It's so slight, I almost never notice.  So when it's scheduled to vacuum it won't do anything or the battery will be dead. It needs to redock itself automatically when this happens. 2. I've never had a dustbin full error despite it being so stuffed with dirt and dog hair, it's no longer picking anything up. Either the sensors are sensitive enough, or they need to adjust the algorithm in their firmware, because it's no longer automated if I have to stop it mid clean to empty the dustbin 3. The mopping actually works pretty well, but it's really annoying to use if you have carpet, which needs to be individually bordered off in the app each time you want to mop. This is easily an extra 3 to 4 minutes of prep time. And you have to remove it when it's back to just the vacuum. Again, ruins the automation part of having a robot vacuum. They really need to different maps that stay saved, one for mopping and one for vacuuming. I tried using the multifloor functionality, but the app got confused that it was the exact same layout and kept switching maps and stranding the robot. The reason for the 2 stars is because these are really easy problems to fix but they absolutely ruin one of the big selling points of something like this which is not having to be involved.

Moreover, the mopping feature is terrible. You can't add soap because they say it will corrode the system which means you are limited to mopping just with water! Further, it doesn't rotate or include any motion - it just drags a damp, soapless piece of cloth around. But on top of that, the thing will just stop in the middle of the floor for no reason. It registers an error but there is no obstruction, nothing. It's going back.","1.0","2"
"William K. Volkman","Color: Black","Does not mop and does poorly on carpet.  Good on wood floor","24 Jan 2021","First run it missed about 25% of the floor, it got better after firmware update and a couple more runs at cleaning. Still misses about 10% which it catches on the next run.  It seemed to climb from flooring to carpet without issue, ramped up the suction however the carpet was not getting cleaned.  It went under the bed and then pushed the dust bunnies around the rest of the room.  After the 4 vacuum passes (3 recommended) I tried the mop.  It would have worked better to dampen a towel and drag it across the floor.  It made about a 2 inch wide swath of dampness as it moved around without any visible effect on the flooring, that dark streak in the middle of the photo.  When nudged off the dock it did back up and re-dock.  Was good at not bumping into things though it still liked to try to eat cords near the wall and managed to dig one out from behind the computer. Would have kept it if I only needed hard floor cleaning however I purchased for the whole apartment and the mopping.","2.0","1"
"Marshall Goldberg","Color: Black","Outstanding Performance and Value","16 Apr 2021","Let's begin with the cons: 1) No clean base. You need to empty the small dust bin every few days, instead of emptying a bag every two weeks. If that's a non-starter for you, then don't buy this vac. 2) As with all combination vac/mops, the mopping performance is not good. As above, this is what I expected. 3) Although the room mapping is fantastic, it does not have the most advanced AI, and so it is more likely to ingest charger cords and doggie droppings if it encounters them. At this price, that is not surprising and I don't know how well the very expensive AI robots avoid these hazards, only that they claim to. Onto the pros: My previous vac was the iRobot Roomba i7+. My ex wound up with it. The Roomba was a much more expensive vac, especially with the clean base. While the Roomba's clean base is fantastic, the Roborock S6 Pure beats the Roomba in every other way, by far. The very first time I used the Roborock, it created a very detailed map of the entire first floor of my house. The iPhone app displayed the map and made it very easy to assign rooms, so I can direct the vac to ""Clean Kitchen,"" for example.  Setting up ""keep out zones"" is far easier and more effective with the Roborock. Huge plus to Roborock there!  Also, you can set up several floors of maps, so you can carry the vac upstairs and it will map out and clean that floor without losing the first floor map. The Roomba didn't seem to be able to do that very well. The second huge improvement over the Roomba i7 is the efficiency. The Roomba just sort of bounces off the walls at random until it thinks it's covered an entire room. And it bangs into objects very often, even in mapped-out rooms. The Roborock, by comparison, methodically cleans rooms in long, straight lines. The result is that it doesn't miss spots and it cleans in far less time than the Roomba.  Also, I don't hear it constantly banging into things. When it goes back to base, it's direct and it mates immediately. The Roomba would take forever to get to the cleaning base and even longer to line itself up to the charger pads. Then, the Roomba would empty itself into the clean base with a ferociously loud fan. Because of its efficiency, the Roborock finishes cleaning with more than 50% battery life left. The Roomba would need to return to dock, charge for a very long time, and then continue cleaning. The third huge improvement is the noise. The Roborock is drastically quieter than the Roomba, and when you add in the faster vacuuming time, this is great for people who work at home... or anyone, for that matter. As for smaller details: I have only hardwood floors, so I can't comment on carpet performance. I do have a dog, and the Roomba's brush, while easy to clean, definitely caught much more dog hair, and so despite the clean base, I had to frequently remove the brush and remove a substantial amount of hair from it. The Roborock catches far less hair in its roller. Big plus to the Roborock in this respect. Removing and cleaning the brushes is similar, although the Roborock has some tiny pieces which need to be reassembled correctly. The Roomba brush is a little bit easier to reassemble, but this is a minor issue. Neither the Roomba i7 nor the Roborock S6 Pure have premium object avoidance. They will suck up charger cables, small socks, and other small obstacles if they encounter them. My big fear is doggie droppings. Although I haven't had this catastrophe yet, i don't think either vac will avoid sucking up and splattering doggie dirt and making a major mess. Otherwise, it's a great vac to have if you have pets. Maybe not an un-housebroken puppy, though. There are the super-premium, AI robots which are said to be able to avoid dog droppings, but I don't know if they work. Overall, I highly recommend this product. I wish that they had a clean base option for it; I will definitely buy a clean base if Roborock releases one for this robot.","5.0","0"
"Dhwani Parikh","Color: Black","Could be better!","20 Oct 2020","We recently bought a new home and wanted some thing to help out with her daily cleaning. We came across the Roborock and decided to give it a shot. After reviewing all its models, we decided to go for the one that has the sweeping and mopping. Unfortunately I’m not very happy with the mopping as it constantly needs to be refilled with the liquid so I end up mopping the floor every few days. As far as the sweeping goes, it cleans up 95% of the dust but it does miss some dirt.Also, it is not suitable for bigger chunks that can be easily cleaned using a car vacuum. The plus point is that it does not need your supervision, meaning it is intelligent enough to not fall from the stairs and as long as you keep it away from any kind of wire, it will not require your attention. So, my verdict is if you have a big home and if you have a lot of area to clean up every day this is a perfect little machine for you. However, if you are living in a smaller space you may not find it as useful.","3.0","1"
"Edward E.","Color: Black","Rocking the Roborock S6 Pure Robot Vacuum and Mop","28 Apr 2021","I have the Neato Botvac D5 robot which is really good at vacuuming in a concise pattern, but the app and its functionality isn't that great.  I don't like random bouncing vacuums like iRobot because randomness doesn't mean it captures everything. So when I was looking for a replacement for my Neato, a friend recommended Roborock.  I knew I wanted to get a robot for mopping too, so when this went on sale...I jumped after doing some research....well quite a bit of research. I am a raving fan of this Roborock S6 Pure Robot Vacuum and Mop for the following reasons: 1) concise vacuum patterns 2) really good radar (LiDAR navigation) detection for going around objects 3) audible voice assistance/information 4) great app!!!!! 5) ""mops"" as well; you cannot use cleaning solutions, only water, but better than nothing 6) great app!!!!! Yes, I said it twice; you can schedule your cleaning, set no-go zones, clean specific rooms, use it like a remote controlled vacuum, different levels of suction power, see a map of your rooms clean, real-time tracking while it cleans, editing maps, and more. 7) doesn't bounce against my furniture like Neato 8) not a loud as my previous robot (Neato) 9) more and improved sensors for going over carpet or the floor edge 10) ease of setup and connecting What I wasn't a fan of is the following: 1) Neato had a wider brush roller that spanned the width of the unit; this one isn't as wide but has different maneuverability due to it's design of being Round vs U shaped. 2) Neato had a larger dust bin capacity, but again different design of being round vs U shaped. 3) Would be nice to have a larger water tank capacity Overall I am very much satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend this unit.","5.0","0"
"Heather Bannister","Color: White","3 girls with long, thick hair, 2 dogs and a cat - trust me","15 Apr 2021","It sounds like a set up for a joke, right? Well let me tell you, I had some major concerns about buying a robot vacuum when you live in rural Missouri and have all the dirt, dust, mud and the animals and children to track it all about. But this thing is AMAZING!!! I won't post the entire mapping of the house, for safety reasons, but I found it funny that it recognized the cat staring it down and also you can see how it maps partials until it start moving around to get a better sense of things.  VERY intuitive! Anyway, it works just as it is advertised.  It scans the rooms as it works and it creates ""zones"" and then returns to it's starting position once it has reached it's maximum area for a single zone to do the Z vacuuming from there. I am super impressed how well it goes around the dining room chairs and even though it has flipped up corners of my ruggable rugs, it doesn't get stuck on them. It popped right over them which I'm fine with.  It wasn't able to finish my first floor with one charge but it did a lot of it. 997sqft to be exact with a running time of 117mins, so again, pretty impressed. The dust bin was overflowing as you can see in my 3rd picture. Most likely from our bedroom/closet as shamefully, that area doesn't get as much attention as the other rooms of our home but I imagine if we just continue running this daily, that won't be a problem.  Also, look at those lines in the carpet!!! It's so satisfying and my carpet was SO SOFT!  I did also go ahead and clean the roller, which was SUPER easy to do. No tools needed, just pop the cover off and pull the roller out!  I don't know what else to say about it.  The noise level isn't terrible. It came in my office while I was on a call and while maybe a bit annoying since I was on a call, it wasn't bad enough that I had to pause it. Anyway, she's new so only time will tell how she fairs but so far I am SUPER happy I got the Roborock S6 Pure and not the more popular brand.","5.0","1"
"Amazon Customer","Color: White","Excellent purchase!! Highly recommend!","10 Jul 2021","I absolutely this vacuum! I had the first generation roomba several years ago, so my expectations were very low. But this blew me away! We have a variety of floor coverings and it seamlessly transitions from one to the other. I am obsessive about my floors, and with 2 kids, a dog and a cat, I was struggling to keep them clean. It can clean our entire house (1900sq ft) on one charge. I love the app and being able to see where it is/has finished. I love choosing which rooms/zones to clean and choosing no-go zones if my kids rooms are a mess. Suction is great and cleaning the vacuum is easy. Now for the mopping. Again, very low expectations because this is a combo vacuum with mop attachment. It took a few times, but I figured out how to get it right and again....AWESOME. You have to wet the mop pad (not just damp) and set the flow to max and it does great. Mops up all the tracks from the animals and my husbands shoes. It does not differentiate flooring types though so you have to set the zone to not go over the area rugs or into carpeted rooms. But overall for a vacuum that can also mop, this works excellent! I would definitely recommend this!!","5.0","1"
"xscuzmi","Color: Black","Why did I wait so long to buy?","13 Nov 2020","Well the cost was one reason I took so long to buy.  But overall I love the Roborock S6 Pure and I haven't even used the mopping feature yet.  From day one, I let it clean the entire house about 3100 sq ft.  It did stop to charge twice and took about 2 1/2 hrs.  At the same time of the first clean it created a map of the house which I was able to edit, create different rooms and save.  There was one room it didn't get to cause the door was closed so I haven't figured out how to add that room.  I can still clean that area with the other nice feature which is you can choose a small or large area by moving a little box over it.  Worked out nice when I moved the sofa and found quite a bit of dust.  Now I clean rooms when needed.  The app takes a little getting used to but its fairly straight forward and user friendly.  Cleaning the bin is pretty easy, mainting the roller brush and little side sweeper is easy with the included little tool located under the hood. Overall I would definetely buy again.","5.0","1"
"Pamela Piotrowski","Color: White","Easy set up and ready to go in just a few minutes!","02 Dec 2020","I am so impressed with this machine! I took it out of the box, downloaded the app, added it to the network, plugged in the charger and pressed ”clean”. It Went right to work and cleaned and mapped my whole first floor, stopping 3 times to charge, but only because I hadn’t fully charged it to begin with. I have hardwood floors and rugs with fringe, chairs, coffee table etc, which it navigated all very well. It did get stuck 3 times, so I removed the obstacles and it picked up where it left off and kept on cleaning. For a first go I am delightfully surprised at how easy the set up was and how it just got to work with no fuss. It cleaned the whole floor in 70 mins (With charging) and the dust bin was full! Next to try will be mapping multiple floors and the mopping feature. We have a small dog that wasn’t overly delighted with it, but I will be happy to be able to keep his hair vacuumed up! After nearly a month I am still really pleased. I have mapped 3 more floors (my house is split level which makes carrying a Vaccuum cleaner from floor to floor a challenge!) I just dust a room and set up my Roborock - now called Rosie,  and she gets right to work. I have her run on the first floor every day at 4am. What a delight to have clean floors every morning! I would highly recommend the Roborock S6. The only downside is remembering to empty the small dust bin. She does come with easy to take out roller for cleaning and a tool to remove hair, and I shed as much as my dog!","5.0","0"
"Sravani Adusumalli","Color: White","Very good Vacuum. Mop is not so good.","09 Feb 2021","This is my first foray into robotic vacuums and I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the device. The design is pretty cool, the LIDAR mapping is excellent. It just mapped place the first time we turned it on and it always tries to check and verify if things have changed location. The sensors around the system worked very well to identify objects and obstacles in the way. We did not have any issues with it falling off the stairs so the drop sensors work as intended. The app is very user friendly with a bunch of cool features. The zone and room cleaning are pretty useful. The pin and go option was very accurate too. Our home had multiple levels and the system was able to store multiple level maps easily and it is a breeze to change the level you would like cleaned. You can also schedule your cleanings on the app very easily. The suction power was pretty good to and you can adjust between 3 levels. The auto suction adjust for carpet works pretty well. I wish it was a little less noisy so it can be turned on at night for cleaning. The major drawback that I noticed was the mopping part. It was not great, I could see the stains on the floor even after mopping twice. They would not suggest adding anything but water to the mop liquid tank. We needed one device that can do both vacuum and mopping efficiently so I ended up returning this vacuum. If you are only looking for a vacuum, this will do the job perfectly.","4.0","0"
"Matty","Color: Black","Quality / Value / Feature Rich!","22 Aug 2020","This vacuum is amazing! If you are trying to figure out what Robot Vacuum company to go with I have tried a 960 Roomba and now the S6 Pure from Roborock. Hands down not even close Roborock is a better product. With Roomba they make you go all the way to their highest end robot vacuum to get the features that really make a difference in the conveniences you’re looking for. If you have not used robot vacuums before you still need to clean up the shoes, clothes, & toys on your floor in the rooms that are going to be vacuumed. If you do that it’s super rare that a robot Vacuum will get stuck.  With Roborock it creates a perfect map of your house with one vacuum. It knows where it’s at in your house 100% of the time and you can easily create rooms from that map. Once your rooms are created you can now Select the rooms you want cleaned so if there is one room your just not ready to clean yet relax just select the rooms in the app that are ready. We have it clean the kitchen each day, but the low traffic rooms we do when they need it. With the Roomba 960 it will make straight lines in your carpet, but it will need to clean the whole floor it’s on. It also can’t handle multiple levels so if you want to bring it up stairs To clean up there forget about it. Don’t settle for a less feature rich product for the better known brand name. Roborock is quality and I have been using it for a little over a month now.","5.0","1"

We have all tile floors with an area rug in the living room. Set up was a breeze; run the app and it's all automatic. It did a map of the house on it's first run, which is super cool to see. I had to at up an invisible wall so it wouldn't get caught on the step down to the sunken dining room, and that was a super some process. We've had it since xmas eve and have used it almost everyday since. Today my 8 month old puppy tracked a ton of dirt in the house and Grogu made short work of it. I told it which rooms to do and set it on its way. I did have to do a zoned cleaning as a second pass where some of the piles of dirt were, but he got it taken care of with two tries. I've used the mop feature a couple times now....not as impressed as it's not a robust mopping.....more of a drag water across the floor. Don't count on it to do a major mop job, but it would be good for maintenance in high traffic areas during the week so the weekly mopping isn't as bad. Suction wise it's great, and the little bin holds a lot. It will vacum all 5 rooms I have on the schedule in 45 minutes and the bin will be *just* full. I might be obsessed with watching the tracki g path on the map as well. I'm pretty impressed overall and it will def make it easier to keep my tile floors cleaner.","5.0","0"
"David Kiefer","Color: Black","Best machine out there!  Worth every penny!","27 Aug 2021","Yes, they are a bit expensive.  And yes, you may not be as familiar with their name as others but Roborock is the best and far, far superior than others!  Why? The main problem with these machines are that they bounce around and clunk around rather than move lightly and gracefully. In fact most of them bump around your room like a drunken sailor. Roborock changes all that. The LiDAR technology is groundbreaking and gives it a cutting edge advantage that no others can touch.  In addition, it’s sensors and software seem far superior too! No more magnetic strips to block areas only to have them move or the machine move them.  Simply block out the area on the map and you are done!  And no more worrying about it falling off ledges or stairs… the sensor catch the change and stop the machine.  Suction is great and the machine can also sense when it is on a hard surface (wood or tile) or carpeted. Roborock is a beast and far superior to the others.  In fact, there just is no comparison out there. Spend the money and get the best!  It is worth every penny and then some!","5.0","0"

"K.M.","Color: Black","Dog hair to no hair!","22 Mar 2021","It is wonderful. I have 3 dogs and SO MUCH DOG HAIR. The first day I had to run it 3 times in each room to get all the hair. I've had it less than a week and I'm using it once on each room and the dust bin is only half full instead of emptying several times. To be up front...I have hardwood floors with 2 small throw rugs...I give this vacuum 10 stars on the hardwood, not so much on the rugs. On carpeting it may be different, the constant suction changes from hardwood to carpet seem to be where the problem is. May be different if the carpet suction is on the whole time. I feel like by the time it realizes it's on carpet and ramps up it's not getting the whole rug. HOWEVER, I bought this with the complete intention of getting dog hair off hardwood floors so it is perfect. I do run a broom in corners, under low furniture, in small spaces and crevices but it is still WAY less work than the amount if time I spent sweeping and vacuuming, and frankly it does a way better job than I did alone so WIN! Bottom line is if you have wood/tile floors this is amazing. If you have carpet do not use my review for your purposes...look at reviews specifically of carpet owners. I would hate to steer people away from this product by an uninformed consumer...their product doesn't deserve that.","5.0","1"

It’s a good product that gets the job done. But there are a few issues with the product design: 1. It easily gets tangled with any low lying wire and doesn’t realize it when it’s doing so. It kept rotating on one of my wires. It’s especially difficult when you have lamp wires or charging cables lying around. 2. Cleaning tangled hair from the central brush is difficult. I have a problem of hair fall and every time I clean the product I have to spend at least 10 mins untangling my hair from the central black brush. 3. The mop is not as effective. I used it only once and wouldn’t use it ever again. Since it’s a Chinese product I do have a concern related to data sharing. This is due to the data policies of the Chinese govt. I hope there are strong guidelines in place.","3.0","1"
"Randy Lyle","Color: Black","Nice overall, but wet mop function didn't meet expectations","28 Jan 2021","We bought the S6 Pure. I would like to give the vacuum a 3.5* rating. It was easy to set-up using a phone app. It feels solid. It It did a good job mapping our single level home and creating individual rooms. It doesn't mangle small throw rugs while vacuuming.  You can program different suction levels for different surfaces. And it's just fun to see the little guy start cleaning as you head out the door. On the downside, it certainly doesn't have near the suction power of a corded vacuum, but that is to be expected. I've attached a pic of the debris the robovac has picked up over the last 4 weeks. We did no other cleaning (regular vacuuming or floor mop) during this time frame. We live in Tucson (so maybe a little dustier than other locations), have 1 cat, our kids no longer live in our home and my wife and I are generally clean people, so it's not like there is all sorts of debris tracked into the house. We have a mixture of concrete floors, area rugs and carpeted bedrooms. We run it every 2-3 days. It's been a bit surprising to see the dust it has picked up. I consider this a tool to use in addition to an occasional manual wet mopping and corded vacuum cleaning. My reason for the lower star rating is that the manufacturer advertised a wet mop feature. While it does have a wet mop pad and removable water tank, I only want the wet mop to go on our concrete floors.  I do NOT want the robovac to drag the dirty, wet pad across the dry area rugs that are on top of some areas of the concrete floor. The software currently only allows you to create one map for the home.  If I put ""no-go"" zones on the area rugs so that the robovac doesn't go on them when damp mopping, it will also never go on them when the wet mop/water tank is removed and I want it to vacuum the whole room  - area rugs included. I think that is a pretty big design overlook by the manufacturer. A better design would've sensed when the wetmop/water tank was installed and then have software that defaulted to no level changes (climbing up onto an area rug or carpeted room) unless programed to specifically do so.","3.0","0"

The app is relatively easy to use. I've set a no-go zone around our Christmas tree and invisible walls in my children's doorways. I haven't allowed it to run when there are toys on the floor yet, but it seems to sense just about everything else. It does a fantastic job cleaning my home. I have 3 kids under 8, a large dog, and a 2,500 sq ft home and this vacuum gets (almost) all the things! I read in another review about wishing it could do a second pass and there is a setting for that. In the map I like to assign it to clean just the high traffic areas and set it to do 2 cleaning cycles just to be sure. There are a few things I wish could be better. The dust bin is considerably smaller than my last vacuum. This itself isn't a terrible problem except that there isn't anything to notify you if the bin is full. I've also noticed it doesn't like leaves. I haven't tried the mopping feature yet as I'm not too keen on it just dragging a wet pad around. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase.

After seeing how it has helped her to keep her house clean with two big dogs, I went home and immediately ordered the S6 pure for myself.  It came yesterday and I am so happy with it.  Figuring out the technology was a little chanllenging as the directions aren't that great but after watching a few videos and some trials I finally figured it out.  After mapping I ran it through the whole house  again and got more dirt.  I ran it a third time with the mop feature on and barely anything in the dust bin.  I have hard floors of different types throughout my house.  I have one bedroom with carpet.  I did a test to see after two passes on the carpet how good it was doing.  I ran over the whole area the roborock had done with my shark, and to be fair I did not go anywhere it could not go.  I was still able to get a fair amount of dust and hair from the carpet with my shark.  I expected this as carpet is way more difficult to clean.  Still it does an amazing job and I highly recommend it.  I plan to run mine every day because I have two dogs.  This allows me to do an entire level of my house and only empty dust bin when it is done.  I have three levels in my house and was able to successfully map each level.  I simply set it in the same place everytime on the other two levels without the dock and it finds its way after about two minutes to follow the map for that level.  I have a 3200 sq. ft. home and I am able to do each level in about an hour and uses between 25 and 35 % of the battery each level.  The room with the carpet uses the most power and time.","5.0","0"

The voice control via Alexa is a joy to use:  just tell it to start cleaning a specific room or the whole house. Automatic scheduling lets you clean specific rooms on particular weekdays or every day at whatever time you want - e.g., I clean my kitchen and the hallway every night when I am asleep, and it is so quiet that I don‘t notice, except that my rooms are cleaner than they ever were.  The robot also has a mopping feature which I haven‘t tried yet, but I am sure that it is good enough for a quick clean between more thorough jobs with a Swiffer.  This robot is a real help, and setting it up and using it is really simple - l would‘t want to miss it, and there is not going to be a number eight to try with disappointing results.","5.0","1"
"Stephanie H.","Color: Black","Love our Roborock!","04 Jan 2021","We have been using our Roborock Pure 6 for about 3 months and have been extremely happy with it. It cleans our whole house without needing to recharge or have the dustbin emptied. We have two cats, and there is always cat hair to be picked up. It does a great job on tile and wood floors as well as the area rug in the living room that the cats like to lie on. I like the mopping feature and use it often on my white ceramic tile kitchen floor that is so difficult to keep looking nice. Usually, I send the vacuum through first, then do the mopping, but that is not required. Since I do it often, it keeps the floor clean, but I've found that sticky spots and really dirty spots need a little extra attention. Since we got the Roborock, we have mopped the kitchen by hand one time when we had been doing a lot of cooking and baking and there was extra mess to clean up. When shopping for a robot vacuum, we looked for one that had a low profile and would get under beds and furniture. This one does that well, though we did have to put 1/2"" blocks under legs of one bed. Before cleaning, I lift up bed skirts so that the vacuum doesn't read them as an obstacle. We also lift up a few electrical cords that are long and might get tangled. I like that it vacuums around and between all the dining room chairs and even under the couch! Corners are done pretty well. It moves from hard floor over rugs easily, even the shaggy throw rug in the bathroom doesn't faze it. Noise level is less than expected, though it does get louder if we use the turbo feature (we seldom use it). I always control it from the app on my phone and it works well. You can control it with Alexa, but so far, I've only used Alexa to start it when I'm doing a whole house cleaning. I'm not sure you can do any of the fancier stuff through Alexa, but I'm happy using the app on my phone. I like the features of the app and often use the single room cleaning and the zone cleaning. The ""go to a spot"" is nice when you want to add water for the mop and don't want to carry from sink to the dock. The only thing that seems to be a problem sometimes is that the map for the second level isn't always there. It's only one room, our lanai, that's a step down from the rest of the house, so it's not a huge problem. The sensors do need to be cleaned off once in a while. The app will notify you when. You also need to clean the filters in the dustbin occasionally.  We have not had any mechanical issues with it since purchase. Over all, I am very happy with my purchase. It does make cleaning so much easier!","5.0","1"
"Keel","Color: Black","Important Hack Alert!!","23 Oct 2020","We almost returned this vacuum because, although it did a great job of mapping and cleaning methodically in our home, it always seemed to get stuck on our black/white shaggy carpet in our living room.  It also got stuck alot underneath our couch. After contacting Roborock, we were told to cover up the cliff sensors because the black/white contrast of our rugs (and the thickness) created a scenario where the cliff sensors were falsely telling the vacuum that it was about to fall down an abyss.  Initially, we used a white tape but that didn't work out that well -- better but not still not great.  Finally, we looked up a YouTube video and saw that the best way to do this was to put white paper over the cliff sensor and then put clear tape over the paper -- such that the sticky part didn't touch the sensor.  This has worked out great for us, and we've now decided to keep the vacuum. The other problem (getting stuck under the couch due to the thickness of the rug right in front of couch) was not solved but we just went ahead and made the underside of the couch a no-go zone, and vacuum there once a week.  Not a perfect solution, but we robo-vacuum several times a week and vacuuming this small space once a week isn't a big deal.","4.0","0"
"Amazon Customer","Color: Black","Still happy I bought this after a year!","05 Sep 2021","I splurged and bought this a year ago and am *very* pleased to say I have not been disappointed! I had dark visions of it failing within 6 months and then discovering there's no customer support! Fortunately, this thing has done a superb job of keeping my small apartment clean for less than $2 a day. Everyone who enters marvels at how sparkling clean my floors are! It works predictably, and once it's been fully set up, rarely troubles you. The suction is as powerful as you need it to be, and keeps the floor clean. The mopping feature isn't great - it's the same effect as dragging a damp cloth lightly over the floor.. it'll pick up what it picks up, but don't expect it to wipe clean any hard stains. It is a useful feature nevertheless and I'm glad to have it. When I have time, I run the vacuum first without the mop and then make it do a second round with the mop attached. The battery power of this thing is outstanding - no problems ever for my small apartment. My one big complaint is that I have two cats in the house and neither has attempted to ride it once! This makes me think they must make Roombas better somehow, although I'm unable to discover how exactly. Despite this I would definitely buy another Roborock if I had to to. For the price and for what it does for you, this is great quality.","5.0","0"
"KatyDid_KS","Color: Black","I’m impressed","28 Jun 2021","This is my first experience with a robot vacuum and I’m not disappointed.  Easy app and WiFi setup, after charging the first time I had it up and creating its map and cleaning my house very quickly.  I thought I would use it for keeping my wood floors and main traffic areas swept but didn’t expect it to handle the ultra plush carpet in the bedrooms.  It did though, and it did a great job.  The first time on my 2000 sq ft home, it returned to its dock to recharge once, then finished on its own.  Running by zone or room feature allows me to alternate areas and only empty the dust bin once.  I did empty the dust bin a couple times the first time running the whole house, but I have a dog that sheds and live in the country.  That’s how I know it’s doing a good job.  It even automatically ran a perpendicular pattern the next time, so it won’t create a repeat carpet pattern in little used areas. I did not plan to use the mop feature, haven’t tried it and probably won’t.","5.0","0"

"CustAct","Color: Black","Great for maintaining between deep cleanings","10 Aug 2020","We just moved into a  house that has a combination of hardwoods and medium pile carpeting. We also have a husky and a long haired cat that both shed like you would not believe. I was vacuuming every day, and mopping every other day prior to getting my RoboRock. My requirements were fairly simple: 1. be able to manage the husky and cat fur 2. be relatively quiet so as not to disturb us at night 3. have laser navigation 4. have an app where I could manage everything remotely (I travel a lot - outside of the pandemic) 5. I didn't want to spend too much more than I spend on my actual full vacuum. Truth be told there were a few products out there that met our needs but we ultimately decided on this one based on customer reviews, a few other comparison reviews by trusted sources online, and then price. RoboRock, as a brand, seemed to come out ahead of the other ones I was considering, and this model had the added mopping feature that kind of tipped us to purchasing. I've only just started using this gadget that I never knew I needed, so I'll update as we progress, but thus far I am happy with my purchase. Setup was simple - download the app, create an account (either via email or through text), connect to wifi, and the rest is super simple! We had it run it's first run, emptied it, and then had it run a second run overnight. Both times picking up significant amounts of dirt, fur, and other things I didn't know were in my carpets.","5.0","0"

"Amazon Customer","Color: Black","Worth Every Penny!","29 Jan 2021","Could not be more impressed. The mapping capabilities of this robot are wonderful and definitely help to speed up cleaning time once it has learned the house. That is my favorite feature. The app is perfect and allows me to set cleaning times so that the floors will be automatically cleaned while I am not in the house. It is a little noisy, but as I said, you can set it to clean when you aren't home so that isn't very bothersome. I have 2 german shepherds and this has been a lifesaver in maintaining all the hair they shed. The mopping function isn't end-all, but it is good for everyday maintenance. The dustbin is a fair size. It makes it through my 1600 square foot house without needing to be emptied during, but I do empty it after every cleaning because it does get rather full. The water tank is very small. If I had one complaint, that would be it, but it isn't a huge deal. And if I am correct the s6 (rather than the s6 pure that I purchased) has a larger water tank, so if that's a deal breaker you could look into that. I have only had it for about a week so I can't speak to longevity of the robot, but I believe it will hold up well.","5.0","0"
"Noah","Color: Black","Great navigation and obstacle avoidance.","05 May 2021","This is the best of our three robo vacs. The other two are high end, but without lidar, and they often get lost or stuck. The Roborock nav is excellent -- It can easily clean just one room, it understands multiple levels of the house, and it's the most reliable vac we've had. Update: Just purchased our second S6 Pure to keep one on each level, and both the first one and new one are going strong! Fantastic navigation & obstacle avoidance. Easy to schedule certain rooms on a schedule. At least 9-of-10 cleaning runs fully complete without any human intervention. Our floors are cleaner, and these are so easy to care for. The only thing I'd change is to make the dust bin larger, but it's totally fine if you empty every couple runs. That said, the top-loading dust bin is far better than the ones on our other brand (R****), as it's easy to lift out & replace while charging.","5.0","0"
"R. Hedrick","Color: Black","Great Vaccume","28 Apr 2021","This is the first robot vacuum I have owned. I did a lot of research, read numerous reviews and decided on the Roborock 6, since it had a mop option and 95% of my floors are vinyl plank. This was easy to setup on my phone, and it has only got stuck a few times. Twice my fault as I had it clean my son's room and there were loose socks, and other unanticipated items hidden in there (teenager).  This vaccume works in a row by row pattern and not random. It mops too which is great for dusty floors. I can schedule cleanings, or spot clean as needed. Takes maybe 5 minutes a day to empty bin and clean/refill mop head. Is it perfect? No. It can't get all areas in a room due to obstacles, and dried on stuff stuck to floor. But it's wonderful for in-between manual vaccume and mopping. I love coming home to a clean floor. I highly recommend this vaccume for its features, ease of use, and price.","5.0","0"

I did a lot of research and settled on this roborock. I’ve been using it for probably 8 months now and I love it! It was worth every penny and I virtually never have issues with it! My fiancé bought me a roomba for Christmas for upstairs which was much more expensive and in my opinion it gets stuck all of the time and doesn’t do as good of a job. I only tried the mop feature a few times and found it left my LVT floors streaky. But they’re a light color and everything leaves them streaky so I wasn’t surprised. I didn’t buy it for the mop though so that really doesn’t bother me at all. I’d recommend this in a heartbeat!","5.0","0"
"A. Bowen","Color: Black","Awesome product...","26 Jul 2020","We just purchased the Roborock S6 Pure about two weeks ago. I had a tough time making the decision to purchase a robot vacuum. I really didn’t believe they would be worth the money or able to clean as good as a conventional vacuum. We decided on the Roborock S6 Pure, my son had purchased two of the units. He has a two story house and was impressed with the units navigation skills. Man I’m glad we listened to him, this thing is awesome. We have pets, a dog and cat. Pet hair everywhere, it drives me crazy because our wood floors always look dusty. Not anymore because the Roborock cleans everyday. It’s crazy the amount of hair and dirt this thing picks up daily. I have to pause the unit to empty the dust been twice per cleaning, our house is a single story 2000 square foot home. That’s how much this machine picks up, it’s pretty amazing. If the battery gets low it heads back to the base recharges and resumes cleaning. It also has a mopping feature and does a decent job of mopping. We have pretty thick area rugs the S6 Pure has no problem with these at all. The LiDAR  navigation is the key, it maps the house and just works. It doesn’t run around bumping into everything and can even manage to clean under our dinning room table without us moving the chairs. It’s only been a few weeks but I’m extremely impressed with both the software and the hardware of this unit. Being retired a $500 purchase is not a easy one, but I would definitely purchase again.","5.0","0"
"Lou Ciavarella","Color: Black","pleasantly suprised","06 Jan 2021","Pleasantly surprised on how well it does. It maps the rooms pretty good and it vacuums very good.  I have not tried the mop feature as the phone interface documentation is not up to par and I do not want to mop the carpet in the kitchen. Still working on that. The company should do either do better documentation or a video on how to do that.  Reasons I bought this over another are the following: First, built-in mop feature. Others had a mop feature but it is a separate unit. My unit does both. At the cost of these units, I can do a lot of mopping. Second, it does support multiple floors. Since, I have a home with three levels plus one has a sunken living room, multiple floors was an attractive feature. They say it does three levels but I am still trying to figure it out. Here is where the phone app or documentation is lacking. I want to know how to vacuum a room and then mop a portion of portion of the room. They talk about restrictive areas but I want to vacuum the entire area and then mop a portion. Have not been able to figure that out yet. Cons.  The manufacture is a China company and it is unclear that the servers it uses are in the US. Not sure why the Chinese need to know the layout of our homes.","4.0","0"
"Dan Danz","Color: Black","Finally, a floor cleaning robot to rival higher-priced ones.","13 Feb 2021","I've used iRobot Roombas for years, with mixed results.  This Roborock S6 replaced a Roomba 690 and does a much more satisfactory cleaning job.  The S6 has mapping capability, and it's easy to choose schedules that emphasize the likely more dirty rooms for a daily schedule, and then add more rooms, like guest bedroom, that are less likely to need cleaning.  The S6 is quieter, and it continuously modulates the suction intensity depending on if it's on carpet or tile flooring.  The design of the rotating sweeping ""brush"" handles dog hair better than that of the 690, and has to be manually cleaned significantly less.  I have often defended the Roomba random cleaning path, but must confess that I much prefer the deliberate, back and forth, overlapping path of the S6 which mimics the way a human would clean the same area with a manual vacuum cleaner. It's predictable and takes less time.","5.0","1"

I usually go thru and pick up some stuff so that the vacuum can access more area.  Take the time to do that when you map your rooms...you will be happy you did.  The first time I ran the vacuum to map the house, I ran it on the lowest setting.  My only goal was to get the mapping done.  I had to clean out the dust bin 3 times.  Now that I run it daily, I find very little in the dust bin.  That means it’s working fabulously.  I now run each room on clean x 2 and max setting.

It maps the entire house with incredible accuracy. I'd bet on my roborock app more than I would the builder's blueprints. It picks up everything...hair, rice, pine needles, dirt, M&Ms, goldfish, earrings, etc. Good thing the waste bin is easy to empty, both the things you want to retrieve and the rest you want to throw in the trash. The unit is quiet enough. If you think this is too loud, you need to reset your expectations of a vacuum and realize it can't be silent. My dog doesn't like our upright vacuum but doesn't get bothered at all by the sound of this one. The onboard dustbin is large enough to vacuum a medium-pile carpet room in a house with a dog and lots of long hair before emptying. The battery lasts for at least 2 hours of continuous cleaning. Note this unit has mopping capability, but the mop equipment is a separate buy. This cleans my hardwoods so well I don't think I'll need to buy the mop accoutrements.

I was worried it would either get stuck everywhere or avoid a lot of places - it doesn't. Suction power is very good. CONS: One pass/round does not get everything.

It does get stuck in the same place virtually every time - wish it would ""learn"" I vacillated between 4 and 5 stars.  My original headline/title was ""I love this vacuum, so why only 4 stars?""  Bottom line to me is that I think this is probably the best one, at least for the money I spent which I consider to be in the upper echelon of robovac's.  I would buy this one again.

But I found that if I ran my shark robot vaccum immediately after this one, that picked a lot more dirt and hair from the same area that was supposed to have been cleaned(I ran roborock with max power ""carpetboost""). Also this vaccum would get stuck everywhere on the carpeted areas for no reason compared to the shark. Even on hardwood floors, I found it often lacking suction. I didn't try the mopping feature as it didn't look like it it had ""no mop zones"" to handle areas with a mix of carpet/rugs.

Pro tip here, you MUST DO THE WHOLE HOUSE AT ONCE when mapping, you cannot go back and add a room later. Save yourself the trouble. The battery is okay when using it on carpets but honestly I am not at all surprised  because man does it have some serious suction power. I would like it to last longer but it does one hell of a job (that I don’t have to do) so waiting for it to recharge is no big deal. It does take about 4-5 hours to completely recharge though. The mapping is extremely easy to use and very intelligent. This is a pricey robot vacuum but honestly this is one of those things you get what you pay for and holy smokes am I so impressed and glad we bought it.","5.0","1"

With Alexa in every room, along with smart bulbs, switches and security products; getting a smart vacuum was a no brainer and a must have with a fur baby! I had my trusty IRobot for going on 3 years until I started to notice some issues. For one it was very loud, and with a finicky Pitbull they weren’t the best of friends. It also didn’t operate well on carpets. So I gave the S6 pure a try. I was surprised to see how much bigger it was this resulting in a larger dustbin- so win win. It’s a bit taller than I had wanted but still gets under most of the small spaces I needed cleaned. I promptly set it up, charged to 100% and let it go through the whole house . I am a very clean person to begin with but HOLY COW the amount of dust and hair this picked up was impressive! I’m in love and although it’s not whisper quiet, it’s definitely a lot less noise than we’re used to. Happy customer!","5.0","0"
"Masn McWhite","Color: Black","Best Vacuum","18 Aug 2020","This is hands down the best vacuum ive ever had. Its so easy to use once you set it up and put it on a schedule it just cleans whenever you want. I had a few other brands before and this is the best. Its only got stuck once before it was on a long dog bone we have for our 2 dogs. Other than that it maneuvers perfectly around everything. It has lasers that map and help it maneuver around everything. After it vacuums it maps out everything and you can either create no go zones or invisible walls if there is somewhere you dont want it to go. Or if you have hardwood you want it to mop but also have carpet you dont want it to go on. So far i havent had any issues with this vacuum and i expect it to last a long time.","5.0","0"

It is a little loud, not enough for it to get on your nerves. If you want to only do a section of your house you are able to. It doesn’t get lost going to the dock. It cleans exactly what you want it to clean and skips what you don’t want it to clean. Does get stuck on furry area rugs but works well on hardwood floors and carpet. I have not used the mop setting, yet. I will try it sometime this week. I have tried 2 other robotic vacuums before this one and was not impressed. This one is worth every dollar.","5.0","0"

I love that it maps out the house and you can break the floor plan to different rooms. The app could be a little more user friendly (map editing), however I’m pretty happy! The mopping feature isn’t really a “mop,” but just drags around a wet towel. I spray my tile floor with cleaner and run the Roborock a few iterations to mop it all up. I wish this feature has better performance. It also cannot detect hard floors from carpet, so if you don’t barricade or set a specific zone, it will wet your carpets.","5.0","0"

If it was fixed, nothing would compare.","08 Jan 2021","This has made me fall in love with robot vacuums, and also made me grossed out about our floors before this. Like most people we vacuumed once or twice a week, ever since our roborock we vacuum twice a day with this thing. Even twice a day it still sucks up a lot of stuff which grosses us out. The suction on this is wonderful, the batter life is wonderful, the mapping is awesome but buggy at times. The only flaw I've found in my roborock, even compared to my eufy that is half the price, is that around 1/3 of the time that its vacuuming, the brush is turned off on carpet. Upon researching, multiple people have this problem, it's really easy to miss it so it's likely everyone has this problem but they don't notice it. Emailed support about it and there is no way to fix/override this, basically just deal with it. Only ""fix"" I've found for it I'd just to vacuum more.. Other than that one very big flaw, this thing is the best out there.","5.0","0"

I finally changed the rotary rubber brush to a nylon brush that I purchased for my other older Roborock.  Now it is working perfectly.  It hasn’t hung up on the carpet since.

After doing some research and reading some reviews I decided to get this vacuum instead of a newer model iRobot and I’m so glad I did. This robot makes a map of your house (multiple floors if you have them) and then tries to break the house into rooms. Then from the app you can tell the robot to vacuum a specific room(s) or all rooms. The vacuum suction power is above average without being overly loud. It also has multiple vacuum levels that you can adjust based on your needs. It also comes with a mop attachment but I have not used that yet so I cannot review how it works.

Fine on standard carpets though.  Ability to block off zones on the house map is helpful, and the ability to set her running when you're not even at home is good...  unless you've got a cable left or lying on the floor somewhere... in which case she'll be tangled up in it like a hostage when you get home.","4.0","0"

I like how I can set up cleaning zones or clean by room, also has a spot cleaner app.  The only thing I wish it would do is tell when the dust bin needs cleaning, however that's not a big deal.  I just empty often.  I have not used the mopping app.  I really purchased for the vacuum abiliity.  You  connect to Wifi and use your phone to program what you want to clean.  Really a great vaccum.

And just by looking at the amount of dust and dirt that is collected, I realize how necessary it is to vacuum much more than we had before.

A cheaper vac can work just as well if you have the time to keep an eye on it.

This robot floor cleaner has been my saving grace. Pros: 1. It sucks up more hair and dirt than I even realized was on the floor. 2. It cleans and vacuums the floor at the same time. 3. My floors look legitimately clean when it’s done. 4. The app is legit! It allows you to drive it, or pick one room or spot to go to in case you don’t want it to do a full cleaning. You can add virtual boundaries so you don’t have to use boundary strips like with some other robots. 5. My husband doesn’t have to listen to me complain that I’m sick and tired of sweating to clean the floors only for them to be dirty all over again ;0) Cons: 1. I will say even in “quiet” mode it could be little quieter, but it certainly isn’t as loud as a normal vacuum running. 2. If I let the vacuum clean multiple rooms in a row without intervening, it would be dragging a dirty mop pad around and likely leave streaks. My workaround: After each room, I pause it, remove the cleaning pad, and quickly rinse it with dish soap, then put it back on and resume the cleaning. (I’m going to purchase a few additional cleaning pads so I can just change them out and throw the dirty ones in the washer going forward.) 3. It doesn’t fit under my couches, which I knew before I bought it because I measured. If it did, that would be awesome but I’ll settle for sweeping under them now that I don’t have to manually clean the rest of my floors :0) While it does require me changing the pad between rooms, I would still give it a full 5 stars because it eliminates the need for me to find the time and energy to have to do it myself. Highly, highly recommend. If you’re on the fence, get one!","5.0","0"

I'll start by admitting I can not stand dirty floors - to the point where I vacuum the common areas daily. I can't stand feeling dirt or pet hair on my bare feet. I have a problem. This little guy is a rockstar. Setting up was a bit of a pain, please keep in mind it does not work on 5ghz networks (I ended up switching it over to the 2.4 guest network). That took a minute to figure out, then I let it charge. The first time using it I left every door in my home open and watched it work. It took about 3 hours total to clean my 2500sqft home. It had no trouble navigating obstacles, beds, furniture, animals. It worked flawlessly except for getting stuck on the mat we put the water bowl on. Now that the home is mapped, I can set up virtual walls to block that area off. Overall it's worth it. It cleans very well, but isn't going to be a complete substitute for a real vacuum. I have it set to run daily and vacuum twice weekly myself. For anyone who is looking through here trying to figure out if you have to do anything special for the first run- you don't!

"Seth","Color: White","Awesome Robovac with futuristic features","06 Dec 2020","In this day and age most robot vaccums do the same thing. They all have the same sucking power, and they all have spinning brushes. What makes this one stand out is the app. I switched from the iRobot i7 to this vaccum because of the app features. As soon as the vaccum powers on it instantly maps out half the room that it's in. After the first cleaning you should have a map of your whole house. You can then draw virtual walls, no go zones, specify rooms, and even just pin and go, where the vaccum will clean a small area that you pin on the map. It's like having a dog that can eat anything. Whenever I'm cooking or doing anything with food in the kitchen, I'm constantly dropping crumbs and pieces of food on the ground. Being able to walk away from the messy kitchen and say ""Alexa tell roborock to clean the kitchen,"" is futuristic. I love everything about this robo vac, from the app functionality, to the vaccum actually talking to you when you need to know something. The remote control joystick built into the app could use some improvement however. I've used it 5 or 6 times now and am just now starting to get the hang of it. It's very sensitive to the touch, and will send the vaccum dramatically in the direction you move it. Overall, wonderful vaccum. I've had it for about 6 months now and use it everyday.

I only have used this vacuum to vacuum my kitchen, living room, and the front entrance which is probably around 1200 square feet. And I have to empty the dustbin everyday. But to be honest I have 2 huskies living with me too. This wouldve been a 5 star if it had a bin that was twice its size so that I could empty it every other day.","4.0","0"

I could have hired a housekeeper, but my carpet and floors need daily attention with the dogs and this is perfect. It has great suction, maps our rooms great and I feel my house is so much cleaner on a daily basis. I do still use my upright for those areas that Hazel cannot get to, specific corners or steps.

"Amazon Customer","Color: White","Best robot vacuum out there","08 Sep 2021","This thing is amazing. I tried the Shark Ion first and it had way too many glitches. It would map my house and then just go to random rooms when I told it to go somewhere specific. I tried the Bissell Crosswave and it worked well but did not offer the mapping feature. I bought this one months ago and came back to leave a review because of how much I love it! It’s incredible. The mapping is so detailed, it knows exactly where to go when you tell it to, it cleans every single inch of the floor! The only complaint I have is that the mopping part doesn’t move, it kind of just drags the wet pad around. This is not a deal breaker for me though because if I wash my floors properly every week and use this daily, it keeps up with the dirty floors. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!","5.0","0"

The mapping feature is great, but this machine will ignore a vacant spot if it was previously occupied. It is not 100% accurate when vacuuming as it does miss regularly. The mopping feature is not that good as you can clearly see the streaks where it missed dispensing water when the regulator is fully open. I don't think there is a difference in the suction, because the noise level stays the same when going over carpet on the extreme setting. Maybe I was expecting too much, but improvements are definitely needed.","3.0","0"

I basically followed the vacuum around the house and used a board to block where I didn't want it to go.  Then used the app to create no go zones and walls.  That worked great for me. Have set up Apple Home to use commands to clean rooms.  I do not use the mop reservoir.  I personally think adding water to a vacuum is not a wise thing to do.  It's expensive and I'd like it to last a while.  I use a small shop vac in the garage to clean the bin and the filter each time I run the vac.  Works great.  Overall the thing is fantastic.  After you get over the novelty of watching it do its thing, being able to run it a couple times a week has cut down on he dust and accumulation of small stuff everybody tracks into their homes.  No getting out the old vacuum, no dealing with the cords.  The thing is great.  Love it.","5.0","0"

We actually bought two; one for the house, another for an art studio. My wife has severe dust allergies and so we need daily dust removal. Our floors are entirely hardwood. We find that the S6 Pure is completely satisfactory. I am a retired computer scientist and am in awe of the technology incorporated in the S6 Pure. Even with the profusion of gear in the art studio, the device is able to navigate around the clutter and always makes its way back to the charging station while doing a thorough job, even navigating under work tables. In the dining room, it is amazing to watch it navigate a forest of furniture legs. I had difficulty getting the device on the internet until I began to suspect the problem was that my WiFi network does not require a password. That was confirmed by Customer Support.

"Donald Bloodworth","Color: Black","Definitely worth the price","21 Apr 2021","I have been impressed with this vacuum! My expectations were definitely meet. There are things to know. The battery life is drastically reduced if you are only cleaning carpet as the automatic sensing for carpet increases the suction power, which is very good, I have not needed to even try the max setting. The dust bin is small but plenty big enough if you run the vacuum daily. The app is easy to use and gives a lot of functionality and customization and the set up was easy. The lidar sensor makes the cleaning paths so much more efficient, I will only use vacuums with this technology in the future.

It is much larger than my last robot vacuum which isn't an issue, it was just surprising. Though the map still says in the app that's it's in beta, I haven't had any issues with it at all. The no-go zones work perfectly and the mapping of my house is amazingly accurate. I like the option of choosing between 4 different suction settings and choosing one or multiple rooms to clean at a time. It is excellent at sensing when it moves to carpet and increases the suction.

Dust bin lasted long enough that I could do other things for a while.  The first run through about 83m square of our first floor, took about 45 min before I emptied the bin.  I expect that with increased vaccuuming, it would take longer to fill up, assuming the same level of accumulation at our house.  Have not used the mopping function.  Would recommend and have already recommended to others.","5.0","0"
"Mark Lai","Color: Black","Amazing Product! Worth it!","12 Jul 2020","My friend has Roborock S5 for over a year and she recommended me so many times to purchase Roborock robotic vacuum. But, I have 2 stories house. I hope I can only buy one for 2 stories. When I saw Roborock this new model with multi-floor function, I know this is what I need. The only concern I have is if this vacuum can quickly know where it is. I have used it for around 2 months and I need to say it’s amazing. I just put it on the second floor and it does the whole work. I don’t get any issue so far. I strongly recommend this model for people who have more than one story. One vacuum for your whole house. I want to say “ Thank you, Roborock!”","5.0","1"

It is quick and not as quirky or quick to get stuck as other brands. The big glaring issue with the S6 pure is the main brush stoping on carpet (with carpet mode on), or getting overloaded (with carpet mode off).

It's rare that a product exceeds your expectations and performs exactly how the manufacture states it will.  Usually they over hype their product....not with this product!  I  unboxed it and gave it a bit of a charge, downloaded the app and it went directly to work.  It mapped my house and vacuumed my floors all in 90 mins.  As per the instructions I did three full vacuums sessions before utilizing the mopping function.  Let me tell you it works GREAT!  Map allows my new best friend to clean any room/zone or the whole house. I have a 100% vinyl plank floor with area rugs.  It is so smart it powers up when it goes up onto the rugs to vacuum. I highly recommend this product!","5.0","0"

After 3 back surgeries the motion associated with sweeping and mopping causes me terrible pain.  We have a dog and a cat which results in significant pet hair.  I set it up and sent it on its way and it did our entire apartment very quickly.  I laid on the couch and watched.  I ran it three times before I got a less than full dustbin and I had cleaned the floors 3 days prior.  Our apartment is only about 1200 sq. ft.  I did not purchase it for the mop feature but used it anyway and it is okay.  I keep my floors pretty clean so it did not take up a lot of dirt.  I will be using both features now.  I never want to be without this machine.

I was out of town last week and my wife called me and I was able to start it half way across the country to clean up a mess. The box the dirt goes into has to be emptied every time it runs but this is a good thing because that only means its working and also I have 4 dogs!

Sometimes it takes forever to dock in the charging station. 3. App is the biggest problem. It is amazing when it works flawlessly but that doesn't happen all the time. 4.

One element of its design that really impressed me was how capable it was of navigating a certain threshold in our home.

The Lidar navigation builds a perfect map of the floor and the Roborock intelligently cleans it- moving in a linear motion back and forth, instead of how cheaper units bounce off the walls like a chaotic pinball.  It is able to store all four floors of the house as separate maps, allowing it to recall a layout if it moves to a different floor.  All in all, a worthwhile purchase for $399 on Prime day.","5.0","0"

Automatically maps and scans our house easily to know where to clean, adjusts when small items are moved around the house and slows down if someone walks near it. Goes over our high doorway transitions very easily, which was my major concern and also moves from hardwood to rugs easily. Mop attachments works good, I would compare it to a light 'swiffer' type mop one would do manually. Alerts when brush is clogged or bin is full. With 3 dogs, is so nice to come home from work to a spotless floor!","5.0","0"

"Kevin Lingard","Color: Black","Don't know if we got a Lemon but....","28 Aug 2020","... This thing is awful, it promised so much and delivered so little. Firstly it took us (an engineer and an IT professional) over 3 days to get it to register on the network. We had to buy a 2.4gHz only wifi router! When we eventually go it to register in the Mi Home app (never got it working with the RoboRock app) it cleaned twice. First time out it said it was going back to base to recharge and it would continue cleaning when charged but never bothered going out again! Second day it actually appeared to work OK! Third day it left the charge station, traveled about 5 ft then died, completely unresponsive. Put it back on the charger and it 'woke up'. Tried to clean again, this time it got about 6 inches and did the same thing. Tried for a third time and it worked for about 20 minutes and did the same thing. It got picked up and put back in it's box and returned to Amazon. Yes Amazon I want my money back, I certainly don't want another piece of junk!","1.0","14"
"Katie Sasser","Color: Black","You get what you pay for... 2 machines in 2 weeks!","25 Oct 2020","I purchased the roborock s6 pure two weeks ago. I opened it up and followed the instructions for use. I was very excited since this was my first robot vacuum. It vacuumed great the first two times and I was even surprised that it was also a mop! After the 3rd use I noticed that it started to lag. It would start moving quickly then stop and slow down. Then it would start running into things at a fast speed. This all happened within the first week of me owning it. Then I tried to use it again - it wouldn’t work! It kept saying error 1 which was something to do with the sensors being messed up. I do want to note that I have a fairly small one level condo, no pets or children - hardwood floors with the exception of the bedrooms. I returned it to amazon who sent me a replacement. I was hoping it was just a faulty machine. Well I have my new machine now. I followed the same instructions for use and again let the robot clean my entire house so that the maps would save. (The maps are how you are able to control what rooms or areas you want to be cleaned). The first clean again was a success. Here I am again, having issues. This is my second robot Within 2 weeks of purchase. I am trying to get the robot to clean the master bedroom. It leaves the dock and instead of making the straight away to the bedroom it goes the long way and continuously runs into the wall and then the table. By the time it gets to the master bedroom all the maps disappear and the clean is unable to be completed. It comes back to the dock. I started to lose my patience so I let it sit and tried it again later on. I had to let the robot clean the entire house again for it to relearn the maps and it does. Once it cleans the entire house the maps disappear again. I went into my settings to make sure I didn’t uncheck the save maps setting... I didn’t. It’s still checked. The same sound of the motor growing loud and quick and then real slow has started again too. I really wanted to like this robot since it seemed to be more cost friendly compared to the roomba but I fear I’ve made a mistake.","1.0","10"

People are saying online it can’t connect if the WiFi name or password if it has special characters like “!” Are you kidding me?!? Passwords are always encouraged to use special characters and now if I want to try and connect I have to change my router settings and then go in and change the 30 devices that are connected to my router. This kind of easily preventable inconvenience is unbecoming of a high end product. I’m done with it and will return it. Unless there’s a way to connect it to my WiFi without changing my WiFi name or password. The vacuum itself seems good. So disappointing that I cannot use any of the WiFi features.","1.0","6"
"Brian Phillips","Color: Black","Customer support is a joke.","30 Jul 2020","I don’t usually write reviews, but I feel a responsibility to do so now. The robot worked great for 16 months. The warranty is 12 months long and the machine stopped working before hitting 17 months age. I called the company and after three days of trying to work with tech support in China (very limited hours per US time zone) they told me to buy a new machine. I can either ship it to them and they will repair it at cost to owner, or I can buy a new machine. Obviously I would have to pay since it’s out of warranty, I have no issue with that. They told me my machine was obsolete and it would make more sense to buy another product that’s newer for what shipping and repair will cost. My WiFi card is suspected to have failed and there is no other way to control the device. The manual spot clean button doesn’t clean the floor, the device just spins in circles for about 30 seconds and turns off. The biggest issue I have is with customer service. It’s hard to get in touch with someone and tech support, customer service, and supervisor is all the same person. The lady on the phone was audibly getting upset with me because there were language barriers. It was pretty comical to hear the representative becoming frustrated with her American customer speaking English, but the comedy wasn’t worth another $600. So this is what I think may be my first Amazon review, and I had the time to send my caution to you. Hopefully this will deter at least one other person from purchasing their products. The vacuum worked great for 16 months; blew my iRobot out of the water. Customer support is a joke. Ah yes, here is the last email they sent for tech support... lol Hi Brian, Thank you for your reply and info. Robot could connect hotspot from a smartphone. You must get 2 smart phones( A and B) . 1. Enable phone A's hotspot in phone's setting and create a name and password of hotspot. 2. Use phone B to install app and try to make robot cleaner connect hotspot sent from phone A. Forget about the wifi from router in the whole process. Sincerely ————————————————— Alcheman Roborock Customer Service Lmao","1.0","8"
"blech","Color: White","Great product - lifesaver for large families","11 Oct 2020","Overall love this product. We were going crazy trying to keep up with all the messes the kids were making and our hard wood floors were suffering. Upstairs bedrooms were not getting timely cleanings and the hardwood floors were not getting mopped. --The Good-- I can turn this thing loose while cooking dinner or helping the kids with homework. I think for or household of 6 the t8 aivi needs to vacuum and mop every night. Otherwise the T8 is going to have a hard time getting everytthing up on the 1st or even 2nd pass. Autoempty is a lifesaver. The bins on these robots are so small you don't want to be emptying this every night. The mapping - brilliantly allows you to choose which rooms to clean and allows you to set cleaning options. You can tailor your cleaning; e.g., for heavily used rooms you can specify high suction and as many as 2 passes through the room. You can boundary off areas of the house where it can get stuck such as where your powerstrip and cords are under a desk or night stand. --The Bad-- It occasionally gets lots and can't find it's home even though on the map it shows that it knows exactly where it is. This has only happened a few times. It also stopped right in front of the base station today and reported that it couldn't find it's dock. Very strange but has only happened 2 out of 20 times thus far. When I set it loose for the first vacuuming and to map the 2nd floor it was so full that when it came back to the station it couldn't auto-empty because it was so jammed up inside. It really needs to sense how full it is so it can empty when needed. It'd be much smarter for it to switch to ""continuous cleaning"" when it knows it is in a large house. It took me some time to figure out that it was stopping mid-mapping to go back and charge. It took 3 attempts for me to create a map the first time. The mop pad is small and doesn't come all the way to the full edge of the robot so you have about 6 inches against the wall that can't get cleaned. You also have to clean the mop pad after each room. A quick handwash with dish soap and hot water and you can put it on so it can continue. I am tempted to buy the vibrating mop attachment to see if it does a better job of mopping. For now I have it do heavy water and 2x passes mopping the kitchen floors, and I had to run the mop on our floors several times initially to get them clean the first time. Unclear whether that will be an issue moving forward now that they are fully clean. However, even with these challenges it's a huge time saver. Plus now the kids are excited to clean up their toys so the robot can come and do what they used to have to do. And... the robot is honestly doing a better job and doing it more consistently than any of us were able to given our schedule. Now I can use some of the time I've saved to put down a coat of polish more than once every 6 months.","5.0","4"
"Brett T Holcomb","Color: Black","Don't Trust the negative reviews","19 Jun 2021","After months of ownership, this thing rocks.. It traverses terrain that the Irocrap cannot get too. It honestly really sux.. in the best possible way. I haven't even been following the proper maintenance procedures and it just keeps sucking all the dog hair and every other small thing left on the ground. I have had a few of these from various brands, this one has been the best. I cannot understand the negative reviews, its like people expect it to do their dishes, or wash their car or something. It does what its designed to do, and it does it better than I expected. I have two dogs that shed hair like its going out of style, this robot keeps up. If you leave your kids small socks or toys out, you cannot blame the vacuum for occasionally sucking them up, or getting stuck.. that's your fault not the vacuum.  Plus the remote control feature is a blast for my kids, they get an rc car, and i get my living room cleaned.. win win.","5.0","3"
"Prashant","Color: Black","Impressive intelligent machine with one serious flaw","03 Dec 2020","I was pretty sure that Roborock would not work in my situation. I have some areas that are carpeted and some wood. I have 2 sunken living rooms. I’m on Day#2 and I’m impressed. It detects drops where my room transitions to a sunken floor. It also transitions seamlessly from hardwood to carpet and back to hardwood. It also increases suction when it’s on the carpet. Here is why I knocked 1 star: I haven’t used the mopping capabilities yet, but from what I’ve read so far S6 Pure cannot handle programming where it mops and vacuums rooms with hardwood, and only vacuums (not mop) carpets. This is a rather big oversight that I hope roborock fixes through firmware update. It can clearly sense carpet v/s hardwood, can’t you tell it to not use water on carpet either automatically or even manually through the app? Maybe Roborock wants you to shell out additional money and get S6Max for this ‘feature’?","4.0","3"
"Jenn","Color: Black","Especially great for hard surfaces","02 Jan 2021","I really like this vacuum. It performs really well on hard surfaces I only gave it 4 stars on suction because on carpets it cant get everything, but I expected that I would have to go over my carpets once a week with my regular vacuum, so this wasn't a surprise or a big deal to me. This keeps the carpets looking nice in between my weekly vacuuming. On the hard floors I haven't had to worry about doing anything but the robovac. It actually does a much better job than I do when sweeping on my own. A couple things that might be helpful for others when getting started with this vacuum. Run the vacuum first once before mapping out your house. If it cant get under your couches, get risers for your couches first. Its nice to have it get under your couches if it can. Get the mi home app and map out your floors. Once you have everything mapped out you can divide your rooms and have it just clean one room at a time. This is especially helpful if you use the mop feature because you can have it just clean the rooms with hard surfaces when the mop attachment is on. Speaking of the mop feature, don't expect it to actually clean your floors it's not really useful for kitchen type mopping. But we are planning on replacing some of our carpeted floors with laminate and I can see it being useful doing a light cleaning on those types of surfaces once a week. This model has the laser so it does a great job of mapping out a room and getting in every nook a cranny it can fit it in. For my dining room I just have to pull out my chair a little bit and it does just fine getting under the table and between all the chairs. It doesn't have a front camera like more expensive models so it can't avoid small objects like socks or cords so you will just have to do a quick sweep of your house before running it. The battery life is great and I can get the whole main floor about 1600 ft in one charge as long as I use the lower suction level on the hard surface and save turbo for my carpets. The dust bin is large enough to clean the whole house before needing emptied. Overall I think this vacuum is great especially at its price point.","5.0","1"
"Bina Munzani","Color: White","The customer service worked the issue","20 May 2021","I purchased this in Nov, 2020. In April the suction reduced badly and the mode change(Quiet, balanced, turbo, max etc) stopped working. Reached out to customer service who sent some troubleshooting steps that didn't help resolve issue. Now they want me to send it for a week to their service center and pay for one way shipping even though the unit is a few months old and within warranty. I would think twice about purchasing same brand again if they can't even take care of the product within their warranty period. Revised: 6/13/2021. Upon posting the review the customer service sent a pre-paid shipping label to send the unit back to their service center. A week later they fixed the issues and shipped the device back. No longer facing the suction power issue or mode change problem. Thanks to good customer service who took the responsibility and fixed the issues.","5.0","1"
"LA","Color: Black","Roborock S6 rocks!!  Best option for price, for basic robo vacuuming and damp-mopping","13 Dec 2020","I saw the S6 listed (with a great coupon deal) on Amazon after I already had ordered an iRobot i7+ and M6 bundle. I received the S6 first.  Extremely pleased with it.  Easy to use and it does a good job, both at vacuuming and mopping.  (N.B. - you can't use any cleaning fluid with the S6.)  But it does a good job, at its 'damp-mopping' function. I received the M6 (more expensive than this unit was w/coupon price) yesterday.  Of course, this only  mops, and it has a bunch of inconvenient issues (I described in a review of that item) where S6 works better (and also has the vacuum function, so you only need the one unit).  The M6 *does* have the option to use cleaning fluid with it - but 1) I don't know yet how well it works with the fluid, and 2) you have to use iRobot's expensive proprietary cleaning fluid.  (Roborock S6 does a good job at the damp-mopping function, and I think it will be easy enough to Swiffer with a cleaning-infused pad once in a while once S6 has already mopped).  Probably will return the M6 and keep this unit for robo-mopping - (not sure yet whether the i7+'s extra features will be enough to make it worth keeping, or whether I'll just keep this S6 for all purposes).","4.0","1"
"Zack","Color: Black","Best robot vacuum","15 Dec 2020","I finally decided to pay a little bit more for a good quality robot vacuum.  Until now, I have always purchased the cheap models when they are on sale. My last one was a eufy, paid probably 120 for that one. I ended up just never using it, because it was always getting stuck in various places.  The roborock is awesome.  It clearly vacuums up everything. It's first run I was disgusted by how much it picked up.  After the first run, being able to set up rooms on my open floor plan, or just being able to have it map things out is pretty awesome.  I was able to easily setup no go zones to keep it from getting stuck under the Christmas tree. I also like that you can see everywhere it went on the map. The spot feature too is pretty awesome, send it to one location and say go, and then boom it vacuums in one specific area. I haven't used the mopping feature, and to be honest probably won't, because it recommends only using water, which when I am mopping I want cleaning solution.  However, I didn't purchase it for the mop, it was just a nice added feature in my opinion.  I would absolutely recommend the roborock, especially you people like me who never wanted to pay more than $150 for a vacuum.  Just do it.  It's worth it.","5.0","1"
"squirrely","Color: Black","My new best friend","11 Dec 2020","I use this for bare floors in a dog friendly home. It does a great job on pet hair, not clogging. It sucks up fine sand from our gravel driveway, but not small rocks. The remote function in the app that can drive the vac is a little awkward, but maybe that's just me. I can't do video game controllers either. The initial mapping took two tries, it seemed a little drunk, zooming all over with no rhyme or reason the first time. It went much better the second time. I won't be using the mop on this unit, the water reservoir is quite small and it seems to squirt water then run over it with a pad. Not mopping at all. I've successfully mapped two floors in our home and dividing and merging rooms is quite easy.  I like the ability to send it out to do only hallways, or only the kitchen. The vac is relativity quiet. It is quieter than an upright vac. We can have a conversation or watch tv when it is in the same room. Have to turn the volume up just a little on the tv. The dustbin seems small but it can hold a lot. It navigates throw rugs well. It just travels up them, increases power while on the rug, and does it's thing. As long as it lasts the test of time I'd recommend the S6 Pure.","5.0","1"
"Jerry Bowerman","Color: White","Great for dog hair and daily cleaning","01 Mar 2021","I ordered this way back in November so I've used it for months.  I had to write a review this because I love this so much.  The app is super easy to install and run from your phone.  My favorite time to vacuum is when we are away from home.  It stores multiple maps and you can clean just one zone at a time.  The mopping feature is not great, but I purchased more to vacuum.  It is fairly quiet-- much less noise than the Roomba we had years ago.  The only thing I wish I could do is try to back it up using the app in case it gets stuck.  We have metal legs on our sofa that it can sometimes get stuck on.  Otherwise, it is great and doesn't get stuck under beds, bar stools, nor chairs. We have 2 dogs, hardwood flooring and a few large area rugs.  No problems going from one to the other. It has a rolling brush, so it is great on dog hair.  The compartment holding debris also holds a lot, although I do empty it after each cleaning.  I did a lot of research and was a little hesitant of putting so much money into a robot vs an upright vacuum.  I also had a Roomba years ago and was leaning towards a brand I knew if I was going to purchase a robot.  I was able to purchase this on a black Friday sale and it is my favorite purchase of 2020!","5.0","2"
"Ambrose","Color: Black","Works Remarkably Well and Good App Features","03 Mar 2021","I got this a few months back after reading some online comparisons and reviews that showed this one was a good option, and it had a good deal going on at the time, a good bit less than the name brand in this category. A few years back, I had previously tried a non-name brand (different one) and ended up returning it. This one does a good job of cleaning the debris on the floor. I have several boys, so every day, we get more to keep this robot busy. It is very effective at learning the rooms we have, and the map it shows is very helpful and accurate--just had to enable that feature because for some reason it is not on by default. Maybe a privacy thing.. Anyhow, once it maps out the rooms, you can tell it with a couple clicks just to clean this or that or these rooms. It has an easy to use spot cleaning thing where you draw a box over the area to clean. It also has where you can mark off no go zones and even put up fake walls, which we have used to good effect. The battery life is good, more than we have needed to do full cleans on multiple rooms. As you would expect, it doesn't do so great with larger things. Our little wooden ""pattern blocks"" get stuck under it, as do larger pieces of paper. The most troublesome thing is crayons. I had one get stuck on the brush area and it rubbed off a lot onto the brush. So now we just have the boys do a quick pick up before running it. I really like that it goes under beds and some other obstacles, where it can fit. It has really good ability to navigate around things and still do a good job. Corners are a problem, but that's to be expected. I was actually surprised that it could get up and onto/over a rather thick carpet we have in one room. I figured it'd get stuck, but it takes a lot (like a bundle of cords or a bunched up floor mat) to get stuck. The nice (and funny) thing is it sends a notification to you when it gets stuck, asking you to save it. The dust bin fills up pretty quickly for us. We just empty it before running, though, and it's OK. Hairs do get wrapped up in it, but the included cleaner is pretty effective to get those off. Our docking/charger base does not stay adhered. I even tried gorilla two-sided adhesive. I suspect it is one of our boys pulling it up, though. Have not nailed it to the ground.. yet. :) We also have not used the mop function. All in all, we and the boys are quite pleased. It saves one chore of sweeping for them and actually does a better job than they often did. LOL. It's a good quality vacuum robot, and a great value for the price, if you are looking to get one of these robots.","5.0","0"
"Coco","Color: Black","Roborock ROCKS!","02 Jan 2021","My husband bought me the Roborock S6 to replace our dumb robot vacuum “he who shall not be named”. That one slammed around aimlessly ping ponging off furniture and baseboards, yet simultaneously, seemed to actively seek out new spots to wedge itself to get stuck, repeatedly. It was at the point that it was more of a hassle to run the old one than it was to just sweep the floor myself because it was just annoying having to rescue it from its latest predicament constantly. Enter the Roborock S6. This thing is so cool y’all! Granted I am a 30 something wife and mom of two kids under 10, who spends her days discussing such stimulating topics as Curious George and Fortnite, so I’m not exactly on the cutting edge of cool but to me this thing is awesome. First of all, it is quick, it takes it 35 minutes to do our entire downstairs, which might make you think that it is missing spots, but nope, it is very efficient, and moves very deliberately, learning and mapping out the house. I love that I can control it from my phone via its own app, where updates are also listed as applicable. There’s a lot of other options in the app that I haven’t delved into, yet, like zones and mapping. For now I’m happy to run it as needed at the end of the day with the touch of a button. Did I mention that it mops? I loathe mopping, and full disclosure, this will not replace traditional mopping entirely, sorry but it won’t, and you can’t expect it to, BUT it does a FANTASTIC job keeping your floors tidy between deeper cleanings. We have two dogs as well as the previously mentioned kids, so there are certainly no shortage of foot/paw prints running thru the house day to day and I’m very happy that by using the mop feature daily or every other day, that those are cleaned up without me having to drag out the mop. I have no complaints at all, it’s worth every penny. If you are in the market for a robot vacuum/mop this is the one for you.","5.0","0"
"Jeffrey","Color: Black","Beware","14 Jan 2021","First of all this thing uses its bumpers on everything including the walls.  So expect both it and the walls to become scuffed.  I have both carpet and hard wood floors.  If I put the home in a room with carpet it will take it 10 minutes to finally go home even though it is only inches away.  If the home is in a room with hard wood it has no problem. The problem is since the seller is a 3rd party, Roborock, amazon will not process replacements and all you can do is get a refund.  This is a problem if now the price has changed. When it does work it vacuums very well on both hardwood and carpet.  Its a little noisy but still quieter than a standard vacuum.  The battery life is exceptional and I wish it had a way to charge only to 80% to extend the battery life.","1.0","1"

"Shawn W","Color: Black","Overall a good working device with awesome technology. Handheld for more heavy cleaning.","30 Dec 2020","I really like this vacuum overall. Technology has come a long way since these first came out. I had a roomba  about 10 years ago and I think I used it a few times but got frustrated with it b/c it never cleaned where you wanted it to  However, this Roborock has Lidar technology  and is really impressive. The app is great and you can literally watch it as it maps out a room while it's running (in minutes). Once it does, it goes to work and it goes everywhere it should. I  have hardwood floors and a few area rugs. Suction is actually pretty decent. You can tell the suction increases over rugs which, I was impressed by. It's good overall but having said that It won't match a handheld vaccuum in ALL cases. For example,  I put it to test  under a bed  that had a thin coating of dust. I let it do it's thing and when it docked I went back and saw that it didn't get all the dust up and left clumps in areas.. My Miele canister vacuum will do this though so I just follow up with that as needed . But for the convenience and overall cleaning ability I really like this thing. I will definitely use it often.. It has good battery life and it tells you exactly how much battery you have left as it runs on the app. It will dock when it needs to recharge. I have multiple floors in my house. I just take the dock and the device to each level as needed. I like that you can set it to clean when you aren't home. It does create a little noise but nothing major.  I will forewarn you that for me it got snagged on a bathroom mat once but it just shut off with an error code popping up on the app and I just went and pulled it out real quick. It didn't seem to hurt it.  It started back no problem.  Therefore, I wouldn't leave smaller things that can get snagged  laying around on the floor. I haven't used the mop feature yet. I will see how that goes and review it later.","4.0","0"

I moved the vacuum to multiple locations on vinyl plank flooring and it gave me the same message. Somehow I was able to clear the error by jiggling the unit. Two weeks after purchasing the vacuum, I couldn't even jiggle the error out of it. Customer service via email is somewhat efficient, but it's clear it's not US-based because they respond to emails late at night (Eastern time). After sending video proof of the problem, they had me buy a box and sent me a pre-paid shipping label to send it back to them. I'm supposed to get a new replacement when they receive the defective one. Obviously I'm rating this a 1. Not happy with the first defective unit for the amount I paid.

I bought two new filters for it, which at $32 for two small filters I thought was a little pricey, but overall still very satisfied with the purchase and would definitely recommend it. I bought a $200 robot vacuum from a different company about 2-3 years ago and it lasted about a month or so and then it stopped working.  I called the company and they tried a few replacement parts to no success.  Eventually I just gave up and threw the thing in the trash.  Even when it did work, I experienced similar problems many others have pointed out: the robot gets hung up easily, lost, doesn't return to base, etc. The Roborock S6 Pure is a completely different experience.  It does an excellent job vacuuming, and after about a month the only issue it's experienced was one time it sucked up my wife's tennis shoe and got the lace wrapped around the sweeper.  Otherwise it's never got lost or hung up on all the things that gave my prior vacuum fits.  The app is great, but I did experience one minor issue when it lost connection to the WIFI. The way to fix that is uninstall the Roborock in the app and reinstall, which takes maybe 3 minutes.  Generally though, I'm very happy with the purchase and I would highly recommend it.","5.0","0"

This was my main reason for purchasing a robotic vacuum was I can’t stand the feeling of kitty litter in my feet and vacuuming every day after a 10-11 hour shift after being on my feet all day was not much fun.  She does a decent job at keeping this from happening.  I have her set up to vacuum the room where the litter box is 3 times a day and the whole house once a day right before I am to get home from work.  She does phenomenal job with also picking up the hair and dirt from the carpet!  I have not tried the mopping function yet. I had a cheap off brand prior to investing in a Roborock, which lost full suction after a couple of months and didn’t work nearly as well as this little thing does. The only thing I could recommend to make it better is adding the self emptying function like some of the other brands have.  With the amount of hair she picks up even after me vacuum with my shark I have to empty her daily and thus would be a nice option for when I ham out of town.","5.0","0"

"K. Shull","Color: Black","Love the Roborock S6!!","10 Aug 2020","I think the Roborock S6 is the best robot vacuum on the market. My 2 Roborock vacuums (an S5 & S6) have GREAT suction power.  They can even suck up rocks and marbles :P  I also love being able to adjust the suction power from the app for when we want more suction or prefer it to be quieter :) The S6 also has no go zones/ virtual walls which is so much easier to use than the barrier tape & laser towers other vacuums use. It also has zoned clean up (can run up to 3 times in an area) which I use a lot when an area is especially dirty. My S6 was having problems with the laser guidance and I contacted Roborock customer service.  They helped me with trouble shooting.  I ended up blowing out around the laser tower with our compressor and it fixed the problem :) The tower is the tallest part of the vacuum and does get stuck sometimes if the vacuum can get under something that isn't quite tall enough for the tower.  Generally the S6 doesn't get stuck  - if there's an area where it gets stuck you can create a no go zone.  Also it's handy if it does get stuck being able to find it with the app :) I also got a refurbished S5 for the downstairs.  I prefer the S6 because the S5 doesn't have no go zones, but the refurbished S5 was a great price and it's nice to have 2 Roborocks now to help keep up with the cleanup from the family  - especially our 2 indoor long coat German Shepherds and our parrot 😅","5.0","0"

It is quite good at not getting stuck on cords an in tight places, phone charge cords will get caught in it however. Material like plastic bags and silky material will get caught, so keep it work area tidy. the no go and mapping is a must have for a robot vacuum. It recently had an issue where it was not able to map and would wander around randomly. It didnt issue any errors though. I did the basics of cleaning and even reset it. Customer service was helpful but eventually said it was probably the LDS system and would need to be repaired out of warranty. In desperation I removed the the LDS module and there was a bit of material and xmas tree tinsel wrapped around the motor that spins the module. I cleaned this and the lightly cleaned the rubber belt and it fixed the issue.  I guess it was slowing it just enough to mess it up but not enough to cause an error. So so far so good with this little bot.","5.0","0"

You also can’t do the whole floor in one shot as it seems you should, you have to do mop only areas and then take all of the mop stuff off before it vacuums. Maybe an oversight on my part, but they make it seem like you can do a whole floor and it will stop mopping where there is carpet then resume where it can. From a schedule standpoint and vacuuming, it works extremely well and the mapping function works great. We just don’t use the mop feature, more of a hassle than it’s worth.","4.0","1"

"Amazon Customer","Color: Black","Great vacuum, highly customizable, excellent power","18 Dec 2020","I had  a robot vacuum about 10 years ago, thought I'd give the newer tech a try. Had low expectations based off of the previous unit. Did some research, and came across Roborock. Never heard of them before, but other reviews said it was much better than Shark or Roomba. Unit feels significant, programming is easy, though the app isn't the best program wise, is still pretty good and is very customizable. After it learned and mapped the first floor, you're able to program the order of the rooms. It has enough battery to vacuum our whole first floor which is decent sized. The lines in the carpet it creates is super impressive. Very uniform and straight. The dust bin isn't huge, but what really impressed me was how much stuff was in there, the floors looked relatively clean before, but it was jam packed. It will definitely minimize how many times I will have to vacuum the house!","5.0","0"

"Shasta","Color: Black","Good little robot","09 Apr 2021","We purchased one in Dec. 2020, and it's our favorite thing still. He cleans pretty well and the app is helpful. If you have a ton of embedded pet hair on a carpet, it's not going to get all of it out, but it gets most. It does incredibly well with uneven floors. It goes from carpet to hardwood seamlessly. It gets just about every spot on our floor and does well around the baseboards. We have a baby, cat, pug, and conure, so it's always busy. It's so nice it can be started via app or in-person with the button on top. I haven't done the mopping until today, but it was super easy to setup. If your floors are super dirty, I would do it yourself, but this is great for in-between sessions or ""omg, company is coming and I need to clean"" moments. I love this robot and recommend this one to all my friends.","5.0","1"
"Olivia S.","Color: Black","Wanted to love it but unfortunately I can’t","07 Jul 2021","I really wanted to love this one, but it simply just doesn’t work out. I’m a cat owner and my cat sheds crazy pretty much throughout the year. So I really wished this could help me with the cat hair situation at home. It worked, for a brief period of time, until I laid a large area rug in my living room, and things started to collapse. Long story short, it just wouldn’t get on the rug. It is a relatively medium to high pile rug which is about 15mm high , but the Roborock had such a hard time trying to climb onto it. And when it cannot, which is like most of the times, it goes in circles and returns to the dock without even finishing all the area it can reach. And if I try to babysit the robo and help it with positioning? Oh no, it ain’t happy. It gives all sorts of different errors. I of course like the smart features and the fact that it can mop, which is why I bought it in the first place, and really thought this would a productive tool. Eh, maybe it’s not as smart as I thought after all. I’m returning.","2.0","0"

This vacuum cleaner sets the bar so much higher and I absolutely love it. I must admit I was looking for a US-made one but right now there is simply not a good one at this price point. So if you are ok buying a smart device engineered in China then this is certainly the best one out there. The three suction modes work great, navigation is close to flawless; the ability to create your rooms is useful and app works without glitches. I wish I could integrate the rooms with Alexa and tell to clean certain rooms, but this is not possible yet and I hope an update solves this issue.","5.0","0"

"Michael","Color: White","Finally Free From Vacuuming","13 Sep 2020","I previously had an iRobot without mapping capability, so my investment into this device was a game changer for me.  It carries a significant price tag, but it was worth every penny. Pro's 1. Mapping technology is amazing.  My favorite features are selected zone cleaning, selected whole room cleaning, sequence of which rooms to clean in which order, and editing rooms to make precise boundaries or no-go zones. 2. Mop function - this is great for floors that just need a once-over wipe.  I never expected it to be able to scrub, so it has met or exceeded expectations every time I use it. 3. Adjustable suction - works great to vacuum when it needs to be quiet (even while watching TV  or sleeping) 4. Sound levels - as mentioned in #3, it is quiet enough to vacuum while sleeping or watching a show 5. Great Roborock customer service - I have reached out to them a couple times and they get back to me within 24 hours and fully took care of my concern each time. Con's (#'s 1 and 2 are more wish list items and not necessarily cons) 1. Cannot name rooms unless you use the Mi Home app (intended for older devices that don't work with the otherwise great Roborock app). 2. Limited integration with Google or Alexa related to having the ability to tell it to clean a specific room.  For example, if I were to say, ""Hey Google, clean the kitchen"" it would trigger the device to go to that room for cleaning automatically. 3. Mop cloth - the pad seems durable, but the plastic liner that slides into the water reservoir attachment broke through the cloth after only 2 uses (customer service sent me a replacement for free, which was awesome). Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend it for anyone that wants freedom from the constant cleanup of floors.","5.0","0"

It saved me a lot of time vacuuming just remember to empty the trash bin at the end of every day since its really small. In general these robo Vacuums are not the perfect vacuuming machine * they go around in z shape in an attempt to cover every spot) but some areas need to be Vacuumed more than once because it still misses small areas between the lines or towards the edges. Also if your home has rugs or lots of furniture you will probably need to Vacuum yourself once every couple of days to feel your place is perfectly Vacuumed. If the Roborock is moving in a straight line where half of it is on rug or a carpet while the other half is on a solid floor it will probably fail picking up any dirt in this line.","4.0","0"

Bought on a different site since wanted a white one, however, wanted to share what I found out for benefit of others.  Have now used several times setting up maps for main floor and basement.  One of the other features that I choose this vac for was the ability to set up scheduled cleanings by room or zone.  However, found out that I cannot have more than one map and still do scheduled zone cleanings.  With two maps the only option is for whole house scheduled cleaning.  A software shortcoming in the Roborock app.  Hope it soon gets fixed and if the robot continues to perform well would be five stars and well worth the money.

Sweeping the hardwood floors and vacuuming the carpets has never taken priority over taking care of other household chores. As a result, our floors got pretty dirty. When I couldn't stand it any longer I'd get out the broom, or vacuum, but that was maybe only once a week. If that. But now we run the Roborock every night on the main floor of our house, which gets the dirtiest anyway. It has been nothing short of life changing. We've had it for a few months and it's been nothing but bliss ever since. We've named it Mo (from WALL-E) and even got a Mo sticker to put on it.

But the Neato navigation was causing problems, it would get loss, it would rub against walls and furniture in corners, and would randomly get loss by spinning in circles wondering where it was. The Roborock S6 pure just worked!  It created a map of all my floors on the first go.  It cleans rooms on demand and does not get lost!  It creates nice looking vacuum lines!  And its dust bin gets full of dust!  I dont have to worry about it getting stuck or loss, and it cleans each of my floors quickly! Roborock is light years ahead of Neato in software and navigation.  I had to return the Neato D7 as it did not perform as advertised, although initially I wanted the Neato D7 more than the S6 pure, because it had the better design and suction power.  But suction power and hardware design means nothing when the software is not up to par... Thanks Roborock for a great robot vacuum experience!  I'm just amazed on how well it just worked!

"Nick","Color: Black","Pure Savings!","18 May 2020","In my opinion Roborock is the top robot vacuum manufacturer in terms of performance and value. I was so impressed by my first purchase ( the Roborock S5) my family and I have purchased almost every model of the Roborock lineup. I recently purchased the S6 Pure to replace my S5 that I gave to a family member as a gift. I have paired the S6 Pure with my Roborock S6. I like to have two cleaners so I can alternate and extend the life of each machine. I usually vacuum everyday sometimes multiple times a day. Kids are messy! Anyways the S6 pure is Roborock’s updated and slightly less expensive version of last years S6. It provides the same level of cleaning, navigation, and app integration but cuts a few corners to cut down on the price. Before I go into the differences let me explain why the Roborock lineup and the S6 Pure is superior to other robot vacuums. The most important factor of any vacuum is suction and pick-up ability and the S6 Pure along with the rest of the Roborock lineup nails it. The 2000pa suction motor provides plenty of power and “suck” and paired with the easy clean spiraled main brush it can pick up all forms of small and large debris. The one issue I had with my S6 has also been remedied for the S6 Pure. My S6 had a new rubber 5 blade side brush design which proved to be more suited for hard floors than carpets. The S6 could not spin the side brush in the middle of a carpeted floor and would just drag it along. The S6 Pure does not suffer from this problem. It still has the rubber brush but Roborock must have programmed the side brush motor to spin faster or maybe even upgraded the side brush motor. The other major factor for robot vacuums is navigation. Thankfully the industry has advanced from the old method of “bump and run” ping-pong style navigation. The S6 Pure is equipped with an advanced LIDAR based mapping system that can accurately map and navigate an entire house and ensure complete floor cleaning throughout my entire home. App integration makes the navigation even better and takes it to a whole other level. Through the app you can not only start and stop the robot but you can also divide your floor plan into rooms and have the robot only vacuum a specific room. I love using this feature after the kids have made a mess with their snacks! The app also allows the user the ability to designate areas as “no-go” zones to prevent the robot from becoming trapped or tangled. It also has bottom sensors that prevent it from falling down stairs. And to top it all off Roborock just updated the firmware on all of it’s newer Lidar based vacuums to allow multi-floor use. The robot can detect when it is on a different floor and save a map for up to 3 floors. The S6 Pure also comes with a mopping pad that can be attached so that it can mop while it vacuums. It absorbs water from it’s tank onto a pad and does a good job of removing the dusty film that can accrue between cleanings. It will struggle to remove heavy sticky spots but it does a good job of maintaining the floor between deep cleanings. Now let’s talk about where Roborock made a few cuts and the differences between the S6 and S6 Pure. Since I just mentioned the mopping function I will start there. The S6 and S6 pure both have the same mopping function and pad but the S6 can detect when the mopping pad has been attached. This allows the S6 an added function through the app to designated areas as “no-mop” zones which prevents it from mopping on carpeted areas or rugs. The second major difference is sensors. The S6 Pure has a couple fewer bottom sensors but still maintains cliff detections. Another difference is dustbin capacity. This actually is an upgrade for the S6 Pure as it has a slightly larger elongated dustbin over the S6. The last and probably biggest difference between the S6 and S6 Pure is battery charging. While both units pack a hefty 5200 mah lithium-ion battery the S6 Pure is packaged with a slower battery charging base. Now for myself this has not been a big deal as I am able to vacuum an almost 2000 square feet on a single charge and even if the vacuum does not complete its task it goes back to the dock and charges only the amount it needs to go back and pick up where it left off. This smart charging software makes up for the long charging time. Overall I am very happy with the S6 Pure and it is an awesome machine. Like I previously mentioned I have been so impressed by Roborock vacuums I have convinced my Mother-in law, Sister-in law, and Sister to purchase their own and I have purchased 3 for myself! They all love theirs and none of us have had any issues or defects. If you are comparing and researching between Roborock and those other big name brands I can promise you will not be disappointed with a Roborock vacuum. The S6 Pure is just another awesome more affordable product in an already awesome product line up. I have attached a few pictures of my S6 and S6 Pure so you see the physical differences between the machines. Also added an image from the app so you can see the mapping/room select functionality. S6 is white. S6 Pure is Black","5.0","328"
"Sadie K","Color: Black","Definite YESSS! But maybe not the mopping...","19 Nov 2020","This lil guy did WAY more than I anticipated. I'm a little over the top when it comes to floor care and probably have too many floor care products and machines. I have a bissell vacuum, shark lightweight vacuum, bissell carpet shampoo/vacuum (which is amazing), Bissell steam mop for my wood floors which is also amazing. This Roborock collected allllll of that in the pics for the first run through. And I vacuum almost every day! Super impressed. Goes over my carpet and hardwood easily. Navigates every tiny corner. The only downside I would say about this is the ""mopping feature""...ehhh...it just takes a little piece of plastic with a little cloth and spreads water while it runs over it with a napkin like cloth. Might work for people with little bits of smudges. I still use my steam mop. I still give this one 5 stars. Been using it every other day with a child (or 2 if you count my messy husband), a dog and cat. About 3 months in now and no problems. I do recommend.","5.0","104"
"tchang","Color: Black","Great vacuum, pleasantly surprised","17 May 2020","Upgraded from a perfectly good vacuum of a different brand since I wanted mapping. This works even better than I expected. It is much larger than my last robot vacuum which isn't an issue, it was just surprising. Though the map still says in the app that's it's in beta, I haven't had any issues with it at all. The no-go zones work perfectly and the mapping of my house is amazingly accurate. I like the option of choosing between 4 different suction settings and choosing one or multiple rooms to clean at a time. It is excellent at sensing when it moves to carpet and increases the suction. The mopping function is what you would expect. If you have high hopes for a robot vaccuum mop you might be disappointed, but it works as well as I thought it would. Overall very happy with my purchase and no complaints so far.","5.0","27"
"Kenneth James","Color: Black","The Only Vacuum For Me","13 Jul 2020","My Roborock s6 Pure has exceeded all my expectations. I did own a iRobot Roomba 960 for 3 weeks but returned it for the S6 Pure. The S6 Pure definitely outperformed the 960 in cleaning, speed, battery life, navigation, mapping and features within the App. In a space of 1100sf on the 1st level, the 960 took 4hrs 50mins, on 3 separate occasions, and had to charged itself 3 times. The s6 Pure took 2hrs and 1 single charge to complete the job. Mapping on the s6 Pure is very accurate and detailed. I like having the ability to identify different rooms, setup boundaries, and telling the S6 pure to only clean certain rooms/areas all from within the App. The s6 Pure had no problems navigating in and around chairs or obstacles. With a 50/50 mixture of hardwood and carpet, the s6 Pure did not have any problems picking up dirt/debris. The noise level between the two vacuums where similar. Both are quiet. Even when the s6 Pure increased suction over carpet, the unit was still relatively quiet. I use the balance mode majority of the time. Huge selling points for me are the mapping/navigation, suction power, features in the App and increased battery life. The only slight issue I had with the s6 Pure was that it took several tries to dock itself but after initially mapping of the room, that issue went away.  I do not use the mopping feature. I've had my S6 Pure for a month now. Being a long time disbeliever of these robot vacuums, I am now sold on the Roborock products. I just hope the keep packing on features in there Roborock App. I would love to be a tester of there products.","5.0","93"

"Sabrina McGehee","Color: Black","Lots of","14 Aug 2020","I’m just giving this 3 stars and I’m honestly returning it and I’ll explain why - first of all, I have had a robot vacuum (different brand) for a few years that I spent about $200 on, and I do love it but I wanted one that could mop also so I figured I would upgrade. The rubber side wheel gets caught on my medium/high pile rugs EVERY SINGLE TIME to the point where I’ve had to cut the rugs a couple times and I’m constantly retrieving and fixing them. My other robo-vacuum never had that issue. And honestly the whole point of this was to save me some time. I don’t want to constantly babysit this thing. And I’m not a fan of the fact that the vacuum only goes over one area and then goes back to the dock even if there is a ton of battery life left, because it misses things. It says 180 min battery life but I’ve never had it go longer than approx 1 hour before returning to dock. I think In general it cleans well, but I don’t think it’s exponentially better than my $200. I do like the mopping feature but I don’t find that, in my experience, it’s been worth the price tag to vacuum AND mop. I do like a lot of the features though (WiFi, quiet mode, controlled by app) so I’m going to try another less expensive model.","3.0","5"
"Ceejkay","Color: Black","Great little robot vac","23 Nov 2020","Excellent little robo vac. Picks up dog hair and doesn’t blow it around on hard floors. Works pretty good on low pile rugs as well. (Don’t have any higher pile rugs to give an opinion) App and mapping feature was why I chose this brand and it doesn’t disappoint. App just updated for Siri support, and works well. The no go lines and zones work really well. No strips or anything special, they are all done within the app. The brush is good, long hair will get caught in the side brush from time to time but it’s easy to clear. Same with the main brush. Something about the design hair doesn’t get wrapped around the main brush as much like a normal vacuum. The tool provided clears hair wrapped around the brush with a quick swipe or two. The mop attachment/feature is ok. Don’t expect a true mop. It’s more like a swiffer/damp duster. I don’t use it much, this model doesn’t have no mop zones, so it will go over the carpet and rugs unless you make a no go zone. The vacuum is surprisingly quite, this is my first one so nothing to compare it to, but it’s way quieter than a regular vacuum. All and all very happy with this purchase.","5.0","3"
"Priyanshu Jha","Color: Black","Solid performer","20 Oct 2020","After using a Deebot robot for 4 years - It was showing signs of aging, and it was time to upgrade. I had been eyeing a Mop + Vaccum for a while but was holding out due to the exorbitant prices. Come Prime day - I found this one with a good discount and went for it as I had heard good things about Roborock. As it arrived, I found that It's a solid packaging with an upscale feel - does not feel like a Chinese product! The size was about 20% bigger compared to our old Deebot. The instruction manuals were clear and in English. Setup was easy and I was up and running in about 20 mins. The main difference between S6 and 'S6 pure' is that the pure charges slowly and does not have a mop sensor - this causes some issues - like, setting up a custom No-Go zone when moping, but then removing it when vacuuming. It can be a little cumbersome - but I will take the price tradeoff. Coming to the actual Vaccum performance - it's top-notch. I can't believe how much technology has progressed and how much better the cleaning has got. The app displayed a neat (and very precise) map of the house floor and the path robot followed. The app itself is easy to use and lets you specify specific cleaning areas, no-go zones, number of cleaning cycles, etc. With Moping - you get an additional moping attachment that needs to be filled with water, and as the robot vacuums, it mops as well. The difference between S6 and S6 pure here is that while S6 knows that it's currently moping, S6 pure, due to not having a sensor doesn't know that - its not really a problem, if you set up no-go zones on the map and I haven't had any issues until now. Overall - with the price - I am really happy with the purchase and would recommend this product. EDIT: Updating review from 5 stars to 4! After using constantly for about 2 weeks - there are some minor annoyances that I am starting to experience. 1. It's slightly louder when compared to our old vacuum, although, the old one was powered low (1300 pa power compared to 2k) but was meeting our cleaning needs. 2. The app doesn't have an ability to copy map - and have separate maps for Mop vs No Mop! I would ideally like to remove/put on mop attachment and choose an appropriate map, rather than constantly tinkering with the same map based on if I have the mop attachment on or not! 3. There have been zero tangles so far in about 15 cleaning sessions, which is very very impressive as our old one use to constanly struggle.","4.0","0"
"L. Grande","Color: Black","Very Surprised","11 Aug 2020","Note: This model has a mop, but I bought it without the intention of ever using that. My review applies only to the dry vacuum functionality. Our cat is a giant bundle of hair and sheds it constantly. I have long hair myself and am always finding it around the house. I already have an expensive Dyson vacuum and have to run it twice a day to keep up with all the hair. To help with that I started looking into the robot vacuums. I did a lot of research in advance of my purchase since I knew nothing about them and have never owned one.  In my research I came across this model by Roborock, a brand I'd never heard of. I chose it over other well-known brands based on features and reviews of this model and others I was considering. Features I wanted: -long enough battery life to get through the whole house in one run -go/no-go zones so I could keep it away from the cat food and water -good suction -works well on bare floors and carpet -fairly quiet since my husband and I both work from home -low enough to get under our furniture I found that to get all those features in other brands, I had to spend a lot more than I spent on this one. After having it for a couple weeks now, I love it and could not be happier. Besides having all the features I wanted, it handles hard transitions from floor to tile and transitions from bare floor to carpet. It always finds its way back to the base. It is relatively quiet. (If I were on the phone and it came into the same room I was in, I'd have to leave or pause cleaning.)  It navigates around chair legs and computer cables well.  Most importantly, it gets all the dirt, cat litter, hair, fur and carpet fuzz on our floors. Any negatives? Just one. The app is lacking a little bit. It seems to do everything you need it to do, but the layout/flow isn't intuitive. Here are a few notes. 1. The first few times I ran it, I was disappointed that it was missing obvious dirt around the house.  I changed the setting from Quiet mode (which was the default and truly was very quiet) to Max mode.  Max mode is a little louder but the difference in cleaning is night and day. It's worth a little extra noise to me, and now Max is the standard in my house. 2. If you're considering one of the brands that self-empties into its own trash bin, think about this...  The kind of hair and fuzz that collects in my vacuum gets matted in there pretty tight. I'm not even sure it would be able to empty itself in my house, so I'm really glad I didn't spend the extra money on that feature.  That would be something to check on, though, if you want that feature. 3. If you do have a lot of hair on your floors, you might want to run a regular vacuum through your house before you run the Roborock the first time.  On the first run only, my hair and my cat's hair were all tangled up in the moving parts of this vacuum. It took awhile for me to cut it all out of there.  That hasn't happened again since the first run, though. To sum it up, this vacuum does as well or better than I've been doing with my Dyson. Highly recommended!","5.0","6"
"Philip","Color: Black","Most efficient robotic vacuum to date..","18 Mar 2021","After using the NEATO D-5 vacuum for 3 yrs, I can honestly say this Roborock vacuum is the best of the two. Hands down. For the NEATO vac, it always seemed to have some issues, from the start it was WiFi related. I went through 2 NEATO's shipped because of Wifi issues and trouble navigating. Like going in circles navigation. Finally after 3 yrs, I had enough. Especially when I seen they don't update their App. I mean it goes way back for last update. With that kind of support it isn't worth it. This Roborock vacuum, the S6, is fabulous! I mean it is very efficient, has great options, been totally reliable and have had no issues whatsoever, albeit only 3 months of use. But, this vac is just phenominal (sp?), and we love it. I especially like that you can rinse out the HEPA Filter. It also has no confusion, ever, unlike the Neato D5.","5.0","1"
"Peter Eastwood","Color: Black","nicely done! 3d vision function is good. Some improvement needed!","09 Nov 2020","Overall, it is very nicely done. It is pricy. I did expect very high for the robot.  And it does meet my expectations. The features I like, - Map of multi floors. - point to clean. - auto recharge and continue to clean. Though, I feel some improvements are still needed - First of all, there are many Chinese voices and lack of English variants. I did some research. This company has sold many units in China. It is probably why. I do expect more English voices in the choices. - Glass door cannot be seen by the camera. It still shows my glass door as another room. A bit annoying. - Multi level auto detection does not work sometimes. It requires my manual switch. - The trash bin is a bit small. The robot does not alert when the trash bin is full. Overall, I am very satisfied. I have thrown my old irobot away. (maybe irobot does similar things now, but I didn't check).","5.0","1"

I made it clean my apartment everyday since I have kids at home. just me a while to set up initially when I try to connect it using mi Jia’s app, as I thought they are the same product line; not sure if anyone can use that app but I couldn’t and we tried roborock’s own app and worked that way. Also please connect with regular WiFi not like 5G - that doesn’t seems working. I like the function that you can block certain areas - I used it to block my rug areas. The side effect is certain places I would have to hand clean. But I don’t mind since I can do that once a week as it does everyday clean already!","5.0","0"
"AJ","Color: White","Hate vacuuming but also hate dust bunnies?  Get this","26 Oct 2020","This is our second Roborock unit.  We got one for upstairs which vacuums and damp mops every morning.  It is impressive how it scans the room and then moves around everything.  This one is for downstairs.  It takes about 60 minutes to do 1,500 square feet, moves in straight lines and works the corners. It doesn’t bang into the base boards or furniture. It knows exactly where the base boards are and stops just as it touches. The software on your phone keeps you informed on how it is doing and if you need to clean the dust bin, filter, add water, etc. It is pretty quiet and can run without disturbing me when I’m working. Very happy with how it is working.","5.0","76"

"Andrew's Reviews","Color: Black","Super impressed with the mapping & clean up capabilities","29 Dec 2020","The S6 Pure has the ability to roll over cables and items in its way. Mapping with LIDAR is super impressive and helps showcase the product's cleaning capabilities. If you haven't been cleaning regularly, expect the vacuum container to be extremely full and dirty in the first 3-5 cleans and you'll want to empty it out after each clean. Also, the rotating brush in the center is super easy to clean as well, which was a surprise because past experience with other regular vacuum cleaners, they require screws to be undone to release the rotating brush mechanism. In this one, all one needs to do is to unlatch the spring-loaded catches and the rotating brush can be easily popped out for cleaning.","5.0","0"
"Heli","Color: White","Clean and Mop together, good app use","16 Apr 2021","I was skeptical about having to give my house data away to use this robo. But after using it, i now am relieved of the mop and sweep process which took me hours. I have a high shag rug and it gets stuck on it, but happy to have the app to select that no go zone. It climbs on normal doormats for easy clean though, but stucks in the shag types. Pros- It works good on wood cleaning. Cleans more in straight lines according to the map. App is very helpful. Cons- didnt find good cleaning with carpet. Corners are left. Detects floor curtains as obstacle but works around it in zigzag pattern. It just cleans in 1 direction even with selection cleaningx2 so some areas left untouched. LOVe the MOP feature.  Despite this, i would still recommend buying it. The app shows robot status along with dustbin and all. Its easy to open and clean the parts inside, easy to empty trash. The quiet noise feature still has some noise but not bad.","5.0","0"

I usually don’t have to vacuum or mop for at least a week a two by running it once a day. That’s says a lot since I have two cats and a golden retriever. That being said, I know space is compact but I wish the dust collector was a little larger to hold more since it does take in a lot of dirt. I keep having to empty it out. Other than that, it’s noisy like a dishwasher but not completely unbearably loud. It’s definitely noticeable though when you’re watching tv or trying to work and study.","5.0","0"

I will probably buy a second one for our second level (but it does have an app that allows you to bring it up to the second level).  Downstairs is a bit over 1000 sq feet.

Support for multi-level was also a must for our house. The app on the phone is intuitive enough for me to perform the things I want. Though it may not be clear enough for some.  One disappointment was the mop feature. It basically is an equivalent of dragging a wet napkin.

"Victor","Color: Black","Quite an awesome device and lives up to its specs","17 Apr 2021","It is an amazing VAC/mop robot. Great design, great features, simple interface and consistent reliability, for the most part. As most devices of this kind Roborock does get stuck sometimes, so do watch out for those cables, laces and strings of any kind. Roborock will not know how to recover and will simply go to sleep. Probably one complaint I have is the weak wifi connectivity and unreliable Google Assistant integration. For the reasons I do not understand, sometimes Roborock loses the network connection, while other devices are working perfectly well. Similarly, Google Assistant will frequently complain of not being able to reach Roborock. I am OK living with those limitations because all I have to d is to press one of the two buttons on the device itself to get it going. In conclusion: Roborock S6 Pure is well-designed, reliable, performs according to the specs, but sometimes struggles in the area of connectivity and assistant integration.","5.0","0"

"R. Schnapp","Color: Black","Great vacuum. Lousy mop.","05 Dec 2020","My previous experience with robovacs was with a 10 year old Roomba. It did ""random walk"" cleaning, i.e., it didn't know where it was or where it was going -- it just went until it hit something, made a random turn, and repeat... It took forever. You had to manually place it back on its dock to charge. You had to place ""virtual wall"" beacons to prevent entry into problematic areas. You had to extensively prep areas before allowing it to do its thing. Its vacuum was anemic. Its collection bin was tiny. Its brushes fouled with hair. It was more trouble to use than a conventional vacuum. The Roborock S6 Pure is MUCH smarter, thank goodness. It has built-in LIDAR, so it maps out your home as it goes, and you can see and edit the map. The vacuum suction is very good, similar to a conventional vacuum cleaner. The brush is very resistant to fouling on hair or thread. By editing the map, you can designate rooms and no-go areas and virtual walls. That all works beautifully. The mop function is, sadly, a very anemic afterthought. There's a tank you can fill with water, and a pad that the tank drips water onto, and that the S6 will drag across the floor as it vacuums. That's it. No scrubbing action. Roborock specifies that you mustn't put cleaning products in the tank. So, basically it's dragging a water-dampened cloth around. Didn't do much for my kitchen floor. If you were planning to buy this product in hopes that it will take the place of your mop and elbow grease -- sorry. Keep looking. Great robo-vac, though!","4.0","0"
"Sandip","Color: Black","Good vaccum cleaner, but not a great mop","27 Jan 2021","I purchased this item in December as a a Christmas gift for my wife. I was really skeptical of its functionality. Also I was hesitant to buy since this is a high cost appliance. Below is my observations - 1. Initial 1 week of cleaning, the robot will not be efficient, it might clean the same place again and again, specially to the corner areas, between the dinning table and chair legs, but I realized, it is more like mapping the places again and again to getting smarter and smarter. 2. Sometime you might see it is not going to the place which seems to be obvious to you, you might get frustrated, but remember, it is still mapping and becoming intelligent. 3. After two weeks of time, it becomes more smarter and starts working efficiently. It will not vacuum double at a single place and leave other places as is. It will try to optimize the work. 4. Its suction power is good. When it senses carpet or door mat/rug it increases its suction power automatically. 5. It can climb .5 inch thikness of my standing rubber mat at the kitchen without any problem. 6. It always respects a no-vacuum zone if you create one. 7. Mopping functionality is not great, if you have water, it will mop at the same time when it vacuums. If no water, no moping. But if you run the robot every day, it is fine. Overall, this is a good vacuum cleaner. Is this perfect? No. The robotic vacuum cleaner as an intelligent appliance will have to go a long way. It is not there yet.","4.0","0"
"Divy Jain","Color: Black","Leaves scuff marks everywhere and the customer service is worst","05 Jun 2021","Your browser does not support HTML5 video. The customer service of Roborock is pathetic. Our Roborock developed some issues after the return window was closed. It started to leave scuff marks on our baseboards and walls. Also when doing cleaning for one specific area it would start to go to other rooms. After some time the brush roll attachment got loose and would come off while the robot vacuum was cleaning. We approached the customer service but the way they handled our issues was really bad. They connected us to warranty department who gave us really stupid solutions like putting an invisible wall across our whole home. When I pointed out that this solution is impossible to implement and it should work normally they told us that issue is with the wall color as one of our wall was blue even though the marks were on both white and blue walls. I can’t believe they were giving us these reasons which sounded foolish to me. Then for the brush roll they told up us to buy new brush. Again upon pointing that the attachment is falling out they told us the problem is with our floor. Our floor is not properly done and it already had scratches not to mention we have a newly build home. After that they stopped replying to our mails. They didn’t offered any solution for any of our problem the most important one was scuff marks all  over our baseboards and walls. This is the worst warranty experience we faced so far. We wasted our $400 on a product which is just lying and our new house walls/baseboards have scuff marks all over. This product is not worth of your time and money. Stay away from this.","1.0","1"
"Tim Schneider","Color: Black","Great value","09 Apr 2021","I don't use the mop function so my review is only the vacuum function. Set up was easy and didn't take long. Easy to use, rooms look great after vacuuming. I'm surprised how well it handles obstacles such as area rugs by doors and my kitchen sink.  It has had issues such as getting under a corner of a rug but has never gotten stuck. It has a great mapping function that I easley edited into separate rooms with some no go areas.  Now it's easy to do a special cleaning of a select area as needed. Battery lasts for my 1600 square foot home under normal cleaning settings.  The other day I set it on max cleaning and it had to recharge once to complete all areas.  After recharging it picked up where it left off.  I wasn't surprised that it needed to recharge as it not only increased the amount of suction but I think it made three passes over all areas. The noise level isn't especially quite but I don't consider it loud either.  The amount of noise gives a sense of where it's at and that it's still doing it's job.  Although you can look at the app to see what it has cleaned and what it is currently vacuuming. I'm very pleased with this vacuum and recommend it's purchase. I received a great Black Friday deal.","5.0","0"

"Diego Gomez","Color: Black","Worth every penny for Husky owners with wood floors!","03 Aug 2021","After reading many reviews and researching various remote vacuum cleaners, I am beyond impressed with Roborock S6 Pure. I run it everyday and am mopping my living room as I sit on my couch writing this review. It picks up all the hair and dirt from my 3 dogs, including  one super shedding Husky, and leaves my floors clean and spotless. Before Roborock, I was dusting snd mopping for at least an hour everyday. This vacuum is saving me hours of work! It maneuvers around the dining room chair legs and under the table. The App also has a virtual boundary feature which is helpful for blocking certain rooms or spaces that you don’t want the Roborock to clean. I absolutely love and highly recommend this product.","5.0","0"
"Scott","Color: Black","Great Time Saver","20 Jan 2021","We have a new baby in the family and we all know what that means - no time to keep the house from falling apart. This Roborock vacuum is a lifesaver! With the baby crawling around on the floor it was impossible to feel like the floor was ever clean enough. We now run this vacuum once a day and everything looks spotless. Pros: Great suction with 4 different power levels Can set go and no-go zones which was great around the holidays with various decorations around the house Doesn't get lost like other robovacs do. The laser guidance is spot on and I've never had to reset the location on my vacuum Can clean room by room or in different zones depending on what you need Cons: Mopping could be a little better but we just use this as a maintenance feature to keep from needing to mop as often My wife's hair sometimes clogs the brush from working properly. There's no real way to avoid this though Overall this vacuum has been a great time saver and allows me to spend more time with my wife and son. Worth every penny!","5.0","1"

"Marce R.","Color: Black","Buena aspiradora, mal mopping","06 Aug 2020","La verdad, sin duda es el mejor regalo que me ha dado mi esposo. Ya quiero que me regale otra pues tenemos una casa de dos plantas, y cada que la bajo me da miedo que se me caiga o dañarla. Tenemos dos perritas de tamaño mediano-grande y tiran bastante pelo, pero la roborock lo recoge muy bien. Les daré una lista de los pros y cons: CONS: - El recipiente de la basura es chico y se tapa fácil. Cada que termino de limpiar una planta debo de limpiarlo antes de ponerme a limpiar la otra planta. - Midan súper bien sus camas, pues aun que pasa muy bien por debajo de la mayoría de los muebles, por dos de las camas de mi casa no, por lo que una vez a la semana debo de usar la escoba para aventar la basura (pelos de mis perritas) hacia afuera de la cama y que los recoja. - El mopping device, ese la verdad no es tan bueno, a penas tengo dos semanas con mi roborock pure, y sólo lo he puesto 2 veces. No se si es por el hecho de que recomiendan no ponerle quimicos, sólo agua, pero definitivamente si deja manchitas y pues, debo de terminar trapeando yo. - En cosas que son altas a veces se sube, pero se atora al bajar. Hago este comentario por que siempre se atora en la base del columpio de mi hija. - No es tan silenciosa como se publica. - Se van a necesitar repuestos. Aun no me toca uno, pero por lo que leí deberá de ser al menos una vez al año. Cuando haga estos reemplazos edito mi comentario a ver que tal. PROS: - Recoge toda basura que está a su paso. - Sus sensores son muy buenos, por lo que puedo poner a aspirar la casa en lo que yo trabajo, sin preocuparme de que se caiga por las escaleras (salvo la base del columpio). - La aplicación, aun que no supe guardar dos mapas por separado, después de dos o tres limpiezas, dejó grabadas las dos plantas de mi casa, sólo que lo marca como si fuera una sola parte de la casa. Cabe destacar que aquí las dos plantas se traslapan donde está su dock (sólo lo tengo en la planta alta, pero se marca en el centro y ya sea que limpie planta alta o baja, esa zona se marca de ambas. Honestamente sólo estoy esperando un buen descuento para compararme otro, ya sea la roborcok s6, o la roborock s6 pure.","5.0","2"
